The [Code & Pixels](https://codeandpixels.fm/) podcast is

> A podcast about turning pixels into code.
 
 hosted by [Adekunle Oduye](https://twitter.com/adekunleoduye) & [Kelly Harrop](https://twitter.com/kellycodeschaos). I'm excited to dig into this as there aren't a ton of resources specific to us [front-of-the-front-end developers](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/).
