Marc is the organizer of the Fantastic [Beyond Tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/) conference that happens every year in Germany. I really feel like Beyond Tellerrand should be on every creative person's bucket list. The show is exceptional and balances practical knowledge with diverse creative inspiration. Marc and I talk about the hard work behind creative projects, intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, embracing vulnerability and sincerity, continuing to cultivate joy and satisfaction, even for long running creative endeavors. The value of community and relationships, learning from failure and a whole lot more. If you enjoy the show, I'd appreciate it if you [subscribe](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/subscribe) and spread the news!
