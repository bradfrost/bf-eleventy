I had a fantastic time talking with [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/) on The Big Web Show podcast. It was always a dream of mine to appear on the podcast as Jeffrey has been a hero of mine for my entire career. In fact, his book is what got me into this whole world in the first place. As Jeffrey mentioned [on his site](http://www.zeldman.com/2016/12/12/brad-frost-atomic-design-big-web-show-150/), we had a blast chatting about this and that and even more once the tape stopped rolling. It was a ton of fun, and a huge honor to appear on the show. Thanks, Jeffrey!
