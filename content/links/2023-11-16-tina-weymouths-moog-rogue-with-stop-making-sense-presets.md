This is so cool; I found [this image on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/moogrogue/photos/a.139441829432207/639850199391365/?type=3) that shows the Moog Rogue [Tina Weymouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Weymouth) used on Talking Heads' incredible [Stop Making Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Making_Sense) concert film. ![Tina Weymouth's Moog Rogue with Stop Making Sense Presets articulated using gaffe tape](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1460217_639850199391365_59165843_n-1.jpg) It's fascinating to see the song presets laid out using tape and shapes — a nice little system in a pre-digital preset world! This makes me so happy for a number of reasons: 
 
   * Tina is a legend and is one of my all-time biggest inspirations
   * I happen to own this synthesizer. My childhood friend bought one at a small shop in our small hometown years ago, and sold it to me since he knew I'd put it to good use. He was right.
   * We may be playing several Talking Heads songs at Frostapalooza on August 17th, so owning this instrument + seeing the exact presets has me super excited.
 
I decided to post this because this was found on Facebook, and that stuff tends to get sucked into the ether. But it also looks like Talking Heads [shared a similar photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtPIN1JOhPx/) on their official Instagram page.
