[Brian Muenzenmeyer](http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/) ([@bmuenzenmeyer](https://twitter.com/bmuenzenmeyer)) appeared on the [MS Dev Show](http://msdevshow.com/) to talk about [Pattern Lab Node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) and his involvement with the project. He does a great job explaining [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), defining the [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) project, and explaining its benefits to the hosts. I'm super excited to see Brian getting out there to talk about his fantastic work with getting Pattern Lab Node off the ground and into the wild.
