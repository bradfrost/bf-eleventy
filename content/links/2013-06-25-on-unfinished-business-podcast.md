I had the extreme pleasure to chat with [Andy Clarke](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) on the [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/24) podcast. We talked about a whole slew of stuff: iOS7 redesign, Video for Instagram, what exactly I do for a living, speaking, Pittsburgh, and more! I had a blast and hope you enjoy.
