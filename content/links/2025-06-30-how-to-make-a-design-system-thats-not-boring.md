https://www.youtube.com/live/3_U2tAz4-gk?si=iEdSDzIpI6wVBd61  I [had a great conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/3_U2tAz4-gk) with [Jason Lengstorf](https://jason.energy/) on his Learn With Jason show. We talked about design tokens, the importance of [design system recipes](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-art-of-design-system-recipes/), our [new course](https://designtokenscourse.com/), and the need for healthier/more human/more collaborative workflows.
