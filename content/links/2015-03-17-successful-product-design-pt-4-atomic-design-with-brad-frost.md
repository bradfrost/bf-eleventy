I got a chance to talk about [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) on The Dirt podcast. I had a blast! 

> For the fourth chapter in our series on [_Designing a Successful Product_](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/category/podcast/product-design/), we sit down with Mr. [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/) to discuss [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) and creating visual systems. Brad takes us through the benefits of designing _systems_ rather than individual pages. We chat about [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), creating style guides, and how to sell someone on the approach. We do **all** of this with the grace and elegance of a gazelle.
