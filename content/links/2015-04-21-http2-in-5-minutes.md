[Ben Maraney](https://github.com/Ben-M) gave a great talk about how HTTP2 will speed up how the web works and will impact performance in a big way. Normally I struggle to make it through talks about in-the-weeds stuff like this, but I feel the 5-minute format was just perfect for this. I'd love to see more of this kind of stuff.
