Source: _[Popcorn Style - Meetings that make you smile.](https://popcorn.style/)_ There's so much greatness on display here. [Popcorn Style](https://popcorn.style/) is a tool for running standups in a way more efficient and fun way! Here's why I love it: 
 
   * **Respect:** we need to respect people and their time. Standup meetings often meander and waste peoples' time. Popcorn Style is a forcing function to get to the meat so talented humans can go back to doing important things!
   * **Fun:** Friends, we need more FUN in our workday. This whole format is a vehicle for introducing much-needed fun into our professional lives. I mean, shit, look at how fun that interface is! And there are fun prompts like "What's your go-to takeout order?" or you can create your own.
   * **Cheap:** 3 bucks a month. Man, more stuff needs this kind of pricing! Simple utilities that are worth at least a couple bucks.
 
I love [Jamie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkosoy/), his playful spirit, and the fact that he's delivered so much of that spirit in the form of cool software. Seriously give it a try!
