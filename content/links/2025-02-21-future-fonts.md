I just became aware of [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/), which is "where type designers sell fonts-in-progress. Despite not actively being in the market to buy fonts, I ended up buying [this beauty called Mayonnaise](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/spaghetype/mayonnaise) and swapping out a boring-in-retrospect Google Font for website project I'm making.
