The post is in Swedish, but run it through Google Translate. Basically they did an A/B test between a carousel feature area and a non-carousel feature area. The carousel version only got a 1.96% interaction rate, while the non-carousel version got a 43.03% interaction rate. I'd say those are pretty damn convincing numbers. Death to the carousel.
