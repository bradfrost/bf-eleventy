This is a fantastic roundup of data display patterns. In my own work creating design systems with huge organizations, we've found providing data tables with plenty of options to be critical to the system's success. Some of these patterns are variations on the table itself (i.e. `table--condensed`), but others involve the data table interacting with other UI components. We found [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) to provide a helpful language to help us navigate the thorniness of creating effective data table patterns within our design systems.
