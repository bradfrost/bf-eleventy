We’ve been doing these workshops at conferences and with our clients, and now we want to share them with you. These workshops are available to organizations that would like to offer a private works
 
 Attention design teams: you're going to want a [Sentient Design workshop](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/workshop-sentient-design-ai-experiences.html) with [Josh Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshclark/) and [Veronika Kindred](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkind/). I'm so grateful to have a front-row seat to all of their great thinking and writing, and I'm so thankful for their even-handed approach about how to think about and incorporate AI into product design and the design process. There's so much noise and all-or-nothing thinking around all of this business, and Josh and Veronika are here to cut through the hype with a knife. You'll learn how to go way beyond just slapping AI chatbots on everything, better understand the opportunities and limitations of this new crop of tools, and learn how to pragmatically integrate AI into your design organization. I consider myself to be very much a student of theirs, and I've learned so much. I know you will too!
