[Vibe code is legacy code](https://blog.val.town/vibe-code). There's some _great_ stuff in this article 

> When you vibe code, you are incurring tech debt as fast as the LLM can spit it out. Which is why vibe coding is perfect for prototypes and throwaway projects: It's only legacy code if you have to maintain it!
 
 Like everything, there is nuance that needs to be considered. I love the comparison to giving a child a credit card. 

> The worst possible situation is to have a non-programmer vibe code a large project that they intend to maintain. This would be the equivalent of giving a credit card to a child without first explaining the concept of debt. As you can imagine, the first phase is ecstatic.  _I can wave this little piece of plastic in stores and take whatever I want!_ Which is a lot like  _AI can build anything now! Nobody needs to learn how to code! Look at what it just made for me!_ But if you wait a month, you'll get the credit card bill.  _Did I actually need to buy all those things? How will I get myself out of this hole?_
