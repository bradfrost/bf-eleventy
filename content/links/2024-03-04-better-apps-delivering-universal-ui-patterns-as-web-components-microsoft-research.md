> Why do we see so little reuse of web UI across organizations? Web projects freely use countless open libraries from npm and elsewhere, but it’s rare to find high-quality web UI code which is flexible and reliable enough for immediate reuse. This makes creating great user experiences both difficult and expensive.
 
 [This fantastic talk by Jan Miksovsky](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/better-apps-delivering-universal-ui-patterns-as-web-components/) from 2019 does a fantastic job describing the current state of UI design/development, and articulates much of the rationale for the creation of a [Global Design System](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/). I found myself nodding along with this entire talk, and he naturally spends a fair amount of time describing how Web Components can be enlisted to help us all create and share sturdy solutions for common UI components.
