I had a blast talking to Jared Spool about [This Is Responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/), [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), and [Pattern Lab](http://pattern-lab.info/) on the UIE podcast. I'm going to be doing a full-day workshop about responsive design, atomic design, and more at the UX Immersion Mobile Conference in Denver.
