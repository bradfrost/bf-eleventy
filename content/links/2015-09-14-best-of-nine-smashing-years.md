I wrote a chapter all about responsive design patterns for [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/)'s [The Mobile Book](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/the-mobile-book-deluxe-bundle) a few years ago. Now my chapter is rounded up with chapters from other great authors from other Smashing books. And the best news, you can download it for free!
