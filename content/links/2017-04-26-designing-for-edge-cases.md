This is fun. I'm a big fan of [designing for dynamic content](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-3/#working-with-dynamic-data), which is why [template](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#templates) and [page](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#pages) stages of the [atomic design methodology](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) are two separate things. It's critical to address best case scenarios, worst case scenarios, and everything in between. That's why I think [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/)'s [pseudo-patterns](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-3/#articulating-pattern-variations-with-pseudo-patterns) are one the tool's best features.
