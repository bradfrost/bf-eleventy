The team that built the U.S. Web Design System, along with many many many other important digital initiatives for the United States of America, [was just eliminated](https://18f.org/). 

> We’re not done yet. We’re still absorbing what has happened. We’re wrestling with what it will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our partners and the American people. But we came to the government to fix things. And we’re not done with this work yet.
 
 It's tragic, heartbreaking, infuriating, bewildering, and a lot of other not-great things. My heart goes out to everyone affected by this; to all the people who will feel the consequences of these decisions, and of course to all of the civil servants who lost your jobs. THANK YOU so much for your service.
