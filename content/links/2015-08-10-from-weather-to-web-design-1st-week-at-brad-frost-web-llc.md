My brother started working for me last week. He's a meteorologist by trade, so shifting into the world of web design and development is quite a big move for him. I'm treating this arrangement as an apprenticeship. The folks over at Sparkbox have done a fantastic job advocating for [apprenticeship](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/why_we_apprentice)s, and I think they make a ton of sense. With an apprenticeship, Ian will learn everything that goes into making and maintaining websites, but also help me with other tasks as well. Most of those other tasks will involve helping me run my business, but also other random things like digging up my patio in the back yard. I'm fully aware I probably wouldn't do that with other non-sibling apprentices, but I'm alright with that. Anyways, give Ian's post a read to see what he's been getting up to speed on.
