I love it when [Frank](https://frankchimero.com) transcribes his talks into posts. This is a great one because he talks about creativity, drive, community, and more. There's a lot here, so do yourself a favor and check it out.

All of us tap into this kind of creativity, but only a few of us have developed such a dependency on it.
