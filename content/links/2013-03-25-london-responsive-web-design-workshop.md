I'll be putting on a full-day responsive web design workshop in London on June 3rd! We'll talk responsive strategy, process and workflow, design patterns and development considerations. We'll share a few laughs, shed a few tears, and drink a few pints. It's going to be a blast. [You can sign up for it now](http://reasons.to/be.responsive/).
