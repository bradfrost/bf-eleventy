[Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/) wrote a fantastic post about diving into the modern JavaScript world after not paying attention to JavaScript for a long time. While I'm not as skilled as her when it comes to backend development, my background is more in frontend design and the presentational side of things. So I've touched JavaScript for most of my career, but I also feel very much like an outsider to the world of really robust JavaScript . Her post is full of enthusiasm and embraces a "fear not!" attitude. I love that, and will be taking that to heart as I dive into this world more.
