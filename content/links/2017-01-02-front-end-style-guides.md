Anna has updated her book on front end style guides! The first edition was amazing, and since then we've had a chance to collect a lot of resources on [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/) and interview people on the [Style Guides Podcast](http://styleguides.io/podcast/). It sounds like she was able to weave a lot of that into the second edition. I'm excited to dive in!
