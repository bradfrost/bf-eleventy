Ian sent me [this clip Jamie Lee Curtis](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1289021192580195) on the Tonight Show with Stephen Colbert. It is phenomenal. I adore her. I resonate with so much with what she describes here. I too am an artist. [I too have struggled with that label](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/i-am-an-artist/). I too have stopped putting artificial limits on myself and have gotten out of my own way. I too have [escaped boxes](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/bigger-than-boxes-a-41st-thought-at-41/) in order to find freedom and infinite opportunity. I too know that everyone's expression is unique to them. I too know that this is available to everyone. I too know everyone can cultivate their own creativity. I too know this to be a fundamental truth of human existence.
