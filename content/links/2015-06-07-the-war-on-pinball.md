Little known fact: I'm a huge fan of pinball. This is a fascinating story about how pinball was considered illegal for a long time, even at the height of its popularity. This topic is also covered in the excellent pinball documentary [Special When Lit](http://www.specialwhenlitmovie.com/), which you should totally check out if you're at all interested in pinball. Especially because a good chunk of the movie takes place at this amazing [pinball mecca](http://papa.org/) in Pittsburgh. And if you're ever in Pittsburgh, let me know and we can head to [Kickback](http://www.kickbackpgh.com/) to drink coffee and play pinball.
