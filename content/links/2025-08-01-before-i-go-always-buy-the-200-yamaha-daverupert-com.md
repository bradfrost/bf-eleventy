Dave's right: _[always buy the $200 Yamaha](https://daverupert.com/2025/07/always-buy-the-yamaha/). _A $200 Epiphone will also suffice. This lesson I've learned — and [apparently Chris has also learned](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/07/30/the-200-yamaha/) — is that for some things spending a crap-ton more money doesn't translate to a crap-ton more quality. This is true for musical instruments, but also true for most consumer goods and even services. Even "I need a website" falls into this category. The process goes something like this:
 
   1. **Be interested in something** enough to want to pursue it.
   2. **Start with the cheap or middle-of-the-road option** , or better yet borrow or rent to get you going.
   3. **Kick the tires.** Get a sense of the mechanics. Noodle. Play. Experiment. Practice. Don't be too hard on yourself.
   4. **Build up competence.** Progress can feel evasive, so try to document along the way; you'll notice a difference! Notice when things don't feel as much a struggle as much as they used to.
   5. **Start listening to your frustration.** Are you frustrated because you're still building competence? Or are you frustrated because you're hitting the limits of the cheap or middle-of-the-road tools you're using? If the former, stay on step 4. If the latter, proceed to step 6.
   6. **Research different tools.** The internet — especially YouTube! — has made it so much easier to research different tools. You'll find pros & cons, comparison between tools, etc. A big mistake I continue to make is to make a purchase simply based on impulse or at-a-distance research. If possible, I recommend getting hands on with whatever you're looking to get before you buy.
   7. **Make an informed purchase** of the next-tier tool.
   8. **Spend a ton of time with your new tool!** Notice things: what's the same as the old tool? What's different? What's better? What's worse? Rose-colored glasses can be a real curse during this stage. Try to cut through it and honestly assess how it's working out.
   9. **DON'T GET RID OF THE OTHER TOOL** if you can help it. It's really helpful to go from one to the other as a way of comparing. But I've also learned that many tools aren't objectively better or worse; they're usually just different. Different tools can perform different jobs, so it's good to have them on hand if you can swing it.
   10. **Continue using the tools** , analyzing and assessing along the way. Hopefully you're well on your way to mastery and you have all the tools you need to continue the journey. But sometimes you may need to start this process (at step 4 or 5) again!
