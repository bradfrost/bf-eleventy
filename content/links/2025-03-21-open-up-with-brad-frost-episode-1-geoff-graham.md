[Here's Geoff Graham on our new Open Up show](https://geoffgraham.me/open-up-with-brad-frost-episode-1/):

> There are a lot of _feelings_  in tech. We feel a certain way about our jobs. We feel certain ways about certain web development techniques. We feel certain things about the landscape of web development and our place in it as developers. But we rarely talk about those feelings. Nay, they usually take a back seat to discourse about the _specific_  things we use in our work: what’s that library you’re importing? What Figma plugins do you use daily? Why would you ever write CSS in JavaScript (no, seriously, why?!). That’s the bent behind _[Open Up](https://smashingconf.com/open-up)_ , a new podcast I’m co-hosting with the unimitable Brad Frost.
 
 Geoff goes onto say some incredibly kind things, and captures exactly the spirit of how I try to show up.

> I’ll be darned if Brad doesn’t have an incredible knack for articulating touchy-feely stuff and striking the right nerve while he’s at it. We covered a slew of topics ranging from job layoffs to dealing with lack of purpose at work and Brad not only knows how to capture the sentiment of someone’s issue, but he offers incredibly practical ways of looking at that issue while exercising a high degree of empathy that you’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere else.
 
 Thanks Geoff, this is one of the best compliments I've ever received. I'll see if this fits on a tombstone.

> I’d say I’m there for a smidge of additional perspective and color commentary.
 
 Uh, sorry, but I call bullshit, Geoff! Unless by "smidge" you mean "mountain-sized doses of perspective and insights". So incredibly grateful to have you as a partner on this.

> I really jumped at the chance to be Brad’s cohost because I’ve felt an indirect sense of connection with him for many years, dating back to 2013 when we both decided to become independent consultants. I remember reading his blog post announcing his move and [writing my own](https://geoffgraham.me/my-next-step/) not many months after that. Funny enough, it was just two months before that blog post that [I wrote another one](https://geoffgraham.me/smartest-in-the-room/) in response to one of Brad’s tweets… and [he responded to it](https://geoffgraham.me/smartest-in-the-room/#comment-32)! I’m not lying when I say I feel that our lives have been on parallel tracks for all these years, so getting to hang out with him in a venue like _Open Up_  is a real thrill that feels a lot like coming full circle.
 
 The fact we've been on these parallel paths is so cool, and I'm so excited to have this opportunity for us to come together and compare notes through this show. We're excited [for the next episode on April 23rd](https://smashingconf.com/open-up); we hope you'll join us!
