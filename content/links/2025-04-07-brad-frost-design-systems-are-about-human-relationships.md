I had the extraordinary honor to appear on the [Design Better podcast](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/brad-frost) and talk with my friends [Aarron Walter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarron/) and [Elijah Woolery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahwoolery/). We talked about why we're still passionate about design systems after 12 years, the human side of design systems, the power of design tokens, our design tokens course, the importance of relationships, ADHD, and a whole lot more.
