I've had the pleasure of collaborating with [Spirits Creative](https://spiritscreative.com/) on a few projects, and they surprised me by creating an absolutely phenomenal intro animation for my podcast, [Wake Up Excited](https://wakeupexcited.show/)!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toWF2_-mqeE&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&index;=5  I gave Dusan and Dusan (how about that for a power duo!) some text animation experiments (which you can see at the end of the title sequence), and they took it and RAN with it. When we first started working together, I emphasized my strong desire to let people do their thing, to be easy going, and to be collaborative. And holy shit was I impressed with the results! Especially given the timeframe in which they turned it around. The feedback so far has been nothing but positive. Wake Up Excited! is a brand-new show, but the vibrant intro sequence coupled with my original theme song makes it feel professional, legit, and fun. I'm stoked. I'm excited to collaborate with them more, and would recommend anyone looking for some badass motion/animation/editing work to check out [Spirits Creative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-). And of course I'd love it if you [subscribe to Wake Up Excited! on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-) (where you can watch with all the fun visuals!) and/or on [your preferred podcast network](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/subscribe).
