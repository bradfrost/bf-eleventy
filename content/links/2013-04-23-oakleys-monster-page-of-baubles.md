Earlier today [I shared](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/326423168342450178) a behemoth, morbidly obese website that weighs a whopping 85.9MB. [Here's a link to the Oakley website](moto.oakley.com) (warning: visit that link at your own risk). Phil Hawksworth [documented](http://hawksworx.com/blog/oakleys-monster-page-of-baubles/) this amazing specimen over at his blog. Check out the video, which is amazingly 60MB lighter than the website itself.
