Here's [Dave Olsen](http://dmolsen.com/) with a fantastic read about thinking about and creating [future friendly](http://futurefriend.ly/) content. 

> The problem is that, even when using responsive design, the content on our websites isn’t really able “to go everywhere.” Responsive web design only affects web content. Web content is viewed through a browser. There’s no guarantee the popular outlets of the future will have a browser or that we will want to share our content through one. 
 
 Exactly. Dave and I (along with the rest of of the [future friendly signers](http://futurefriend.ly/index.html#signatories)) are on the same page with regards to what the "Web" is in the broader scheme of things. "Web" in my ["this is the web" graphics](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/this-is-the-web/) doesn't necessarily indicate "browser-based Web". As Dave says in the article, "responsive web design is a great first step when making your content and your organization future-friendly", but it's by no means a silver bullet for ensuring your content is as portable as possible.
