I love this post from [Bruce](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk). It's an acknowledgement that things change, and in order to help others avoid the mistakes of the past you have to know which tools the industry is presently reaching for. I'm also currently in the process of learning React. I've had a reasonably solid understanding of what React is and how it's useful for a while, but I couldn't really write it myself. Still can't, but I'm getting there. I'm learning React a few different ways, some conventional, some a little unconventional. I've been working my way through [Codecademy's React course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101), which I've found to be really helpful for getting my head around syntax and conventions. Next up I'm going to dive into [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) by the always-wise [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/). But the third way I'm planning on learning is to build a web app that I've been working on for a number of years. I've had most of the UI code stubbed out and functional in Pattern Lab, but I finally bit the bullet and hired somebody to help build out the backend and wire it all up. We're using React, which is going to give a really hands-on lesson for how to make a Real Thing with it. I'll no doubt talk more about the project in the coming months, but for now let's just say I'm excited to roll up my sleeves and learn some stuff.
