The folks from The Outline reached out to me to get my thoughts on crufty websites. Of course [I have opinions](http://deathtobullshit.com/). I saw some people commenting on the irony of a site with a really out-there design critiquing other websites. Personally, I love The Outline's design and I think they're doing some clever experimentations with advertisements on their site. The squiggly line motif is awesome. But to each their own.
