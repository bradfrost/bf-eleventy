This is a novel (and bizarre) approach to responsive layouts. Instead of using percentages, it uses `rem` units. [Here's an example](http://codepen.io/dlueth/full/gfECI) of it in action. I'm not a fan of relying so heavy on Javascript to handle layout, and I'm also not a huge fan of scaling the content up and down so dramatically. I see designers squish content down to fit on smaller screens, but as we're seeing with the [iPad Mini](http://alistapart.com/article/vexing-viewports) content is already difficult to read.
