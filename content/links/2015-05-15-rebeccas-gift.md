> **Rebecca’s Gift** provides a space away from the everyday rhythm of life for families who have experienced the death of a child; to assist them in moving forward in their healing process through the opportunity to reconnect, rebuild, and relax by providing that significant first vacation wherein new family dynamics can be developed and bonds strengthened.
 
 [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/) and his family tragically lost their daughter to a brain tumor almost a year ago, and this non-profit has been set up to raise money to give families who have lost a child a much-needed vacation.
