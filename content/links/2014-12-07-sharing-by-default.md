I absolutely love [Dan Donald](https://twitter.com/hereinthehive)'s thoughts on sharing: the pressure, the double-edged sword it can be, the responsibility. I love how he closes: 

> Every time we share on the web, we have a choice. We can choose to be supportive or sarcastic, share something we’ve learned or tear someone down. It’s not always easy to see how our words will be interpreted but each time we publish we have a choice. To try to make the web a good place. To try to be more than an individual by contributing to something bigger than ourselves. 
 
 Couldn't agree more.
