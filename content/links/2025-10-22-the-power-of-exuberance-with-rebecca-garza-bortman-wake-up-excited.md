We have a fantastic conversation where we discuss the importance of family, how music and the arts can make you immortal, her and her husband’s rock-opera wedding, exuberance as fuel, the power of play in life and in work, the power of the stories we tell ourselves and as a society, and how everyone can cultivate their creative capacity. If you're into creative and inspiring conversations, I'd love for you to [subscribe to the show](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/subscribe)!
