I had the great pleasure of chatting with my pal [Sophie Shepherd](http://sophieshepherd.com/) and [Aquent Gymnasium's](https://thegymnasium.com/)'s Jeremy Osborn about all things design systems. As the title suggests, we ended up talking quite a bit about a common gripe about pattern-based design and development: "But patterns stifle creativity, man!" We dive into these topics and other juicy topics around design systems.
