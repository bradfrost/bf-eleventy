Here's Chris with some [excellent thoughts](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/05/thoughts-on-a-global-design-system/) on the idea of a [Global Design System](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/). Between this post and our ShopTalk Show conversation, there's some great stuff to respond to! Chris spells out a lot of tough questions and challenges around bringing something like this to life, and his conclusion sums things up quite nicely: 

> That feels like I’m being awfully critical. Sorry! Like I said, I like the enthusiasm and I do think there is potential here. But to realize the potential, I think you need to ask really hard questions and have really strong answers. Ultimately I sincerly hope it can be done. Having a super robust go-to set of components that are essentially vetted by the world would be awesome. I think it will take very strong set of principals and leadership to get there.
 
 I'll sink my teeth into some of Chris's questions in a forthcoming post! What a fantastic way to advance the conversation.
