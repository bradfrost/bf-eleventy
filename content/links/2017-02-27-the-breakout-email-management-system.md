[Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) wrote a great post about how he deals with email. I especially I love his advice about getting to the source of why you're getting so many emails. 

> If you get the same email more than three times, stop and fix it at the source because something is broken and your email is just the dumping ground for the broken glass.
 
 I've [written about](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/email-workflow/) how I manage my email before, and I've largely stuck to that workflow. But what Wes said about offloading the burden to other channels really resonated with me. I made an [FAQ page](http://bradfrost.com/faq/) for that purpose and also live by [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander) as well.
