Good read from Wired about robots and the future of jobs. I'm surprised there's no mention of [_Race Against the Machine_](http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI), a great economy-centric book on precisely this topic. It all leads to a very interesting question: what happens to capitalistic societies when many humans living in them no longer have to work? Of course there will be new many new types of jobs created, but a higher level of skill/education will be required to attain them. Automation will inevitably and irrevocably encroach on any unskilled position, leaving those unfortunate people who fall on the wrong side of the digital divide without any way of securing work.
