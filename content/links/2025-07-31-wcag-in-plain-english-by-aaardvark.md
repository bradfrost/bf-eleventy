> Making accessibility standards easy to understand, one success criterion at a time.
 
 [WCAG in Plain English](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/wcag-plain-english/) is fantastic. It [breaks down each WCAG standard](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/wcag-plain-english/1-1-1-non-text-content/) and goes into details with beautiful headlines like: 
 
   * What is it?
   * Why does it matter?
   * Who is affected?
   * How to implement
 
I absolutely love efforts that involve making important-yet-sometimes-heavy topics more approachable. Well done!
