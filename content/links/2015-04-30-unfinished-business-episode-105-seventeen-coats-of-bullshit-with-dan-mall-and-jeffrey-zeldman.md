This is a fascinating discussion between Dan Mall, Jeffrey Zeldman, and Andy Clarke about the role of aesthetics in modern web design and development. This conversation is important as there's still a bias that [responsive design is responsible for bad aesthetic design](http://www.elischiff.com/blog/2015/4/21/fall-of-the-designer-part-iii-responsive-design). Do yourself a favor and give it a listen.
