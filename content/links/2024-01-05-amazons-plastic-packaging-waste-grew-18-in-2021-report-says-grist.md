> If all the company’s plastic from 2021 were converted into plastic air pillows — the inflated pouches inserted in some Amazon packages to reduce shifting during transit — and laid side by side, Miller said it would circle the globe more than 800 times.
 
 [This is ridiculous](https://grist.org/accountability/amazons-plastic-packaging-waste-grew-18-in-2021-report-says/) and shouldn't be happening. Here's an idea: **bring back the old-school milk man delivery format.** Nearly every day an Amazon truck cruises down my street. Amazon should provide households with a reusable bin (bonus: made of their own recycled single-use plastic) similar to the ones I'd unload off of the weekly delivery truck when I worked at CVS as a teenager: ![A blue plastic reusable bin with top folding doors](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blue-Heavy-Duty-Attached-Lid-Tote-XL-3-1200x1200-1-1024x1024-1.jpg) Amazon drivers would deliver goods in these bins, and collect the empty bins from the curb or doorstop or whatever. Just like the milk man. It's a tragedy that this isn't more of a priority. This is the type of problem Amazon should be unleashing scores of designers on. [Ruined By Design](https://www.ruinedby.design/) by Mike Monteiro comes to mind here. It's a solvable (or at least drastically reducible) problem, and I'd love to see this change.
