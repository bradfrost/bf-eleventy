Plenty of great advice from two great responsive mavens. I really love this quote from Matt: 

> Design and build for the unknown. Let go of control (you don’t have it), let go of perfection (you won’t get it). --Matt Griffin
 
 And I [agree](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/beyond-media-queries-anatomy-of-an-adaptive-web-design/) with Ben when he says we need to evolve responsive design beyond layout: 

> I think we need to start thinking beyond layout. There are so many other considerations: performance, content and function priority, readability, usability, interaction model, cross-width consistency, etc.
