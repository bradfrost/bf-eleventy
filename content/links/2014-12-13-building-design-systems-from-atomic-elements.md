The folks at UIE have shared a video of my talk on [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) at UXIM 2014 in Denver. I'll be speaking and giving a full-day responsive design workshop at [UX Mobile Immersion 2015](http://uxim15.uie.com/) in Salt Lake City in 2015. You should come!
