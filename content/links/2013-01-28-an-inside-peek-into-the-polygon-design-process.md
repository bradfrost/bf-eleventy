A wonderful, in-depth look at the Polygon design process. In case you didn't know [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/) is one of the best instances of a responsive design out there. Beautiful, pretty fast all things considered, and chock full of really great content. It's great to take a step behind the curtain.
