[Cennydd](https://www.cennydd.com) put together a great reading list for designers. I'm currently reading Donella Meadows's fantastic [_Thinking in Systems: A Primer_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems), but a lot of these other books probably should be on my radar. After all, Cennydd is intimidatingly smart.
