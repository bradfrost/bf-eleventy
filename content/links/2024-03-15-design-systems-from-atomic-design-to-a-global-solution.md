I was recently a guest on [the CodingCatDev podcast](https://codingcat.dev/podcast/4-8-design-systems-brad-frost), where we covered a lot of ground around design systems, including the [design system ecosystem](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/design-system-ecosystem.html), the [idea of a Global Design System](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/), and many of the challenges teams face when creating successful design systems at an organization.
