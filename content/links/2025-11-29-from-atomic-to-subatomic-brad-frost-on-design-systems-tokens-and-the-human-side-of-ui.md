A few months ago, I had the privilege of being interviewed on the [Design Systems Collective](https://www.designsystemscollective.com/from-atomic-to-subatomic-brad-frost-on-design-systems-tokens-and-the-human-side-of-ui-189609dd9ac8) by Shane P Williams. This interview captures a lot of my current thinking about design systems, our [design tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/), collaboration, [recipes](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-art-of-design-system-recipes/), and more.
