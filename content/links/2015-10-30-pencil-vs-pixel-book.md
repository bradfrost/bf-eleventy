A while ago I [was on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYHGi8ING4) Cesar Contreras's podcast Pencil Vs Pixel. We talked about a lot of things, including my little mantra: [work hard, don't be an asshole, share what you know](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/450619808795885569). Cesar put together a book based on some of the episodes, which includes my segment. You can check out the book by signing up for the Pencil Vs Pixel newsletter.
