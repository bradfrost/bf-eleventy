I absolutely love this clip of Paul McCartney showing how to play the bass part for [Ever Present Past](https://youtu.be/fVGk5qm6Mac). He's just so casual explaining it all (speaking of casual, it's weird to see him dressed in a t-shirt). Here's the things I thought were interesting or funny: 
 
   * "Me little baby"
   * "The root notes, which are basically...the notes...of the chords"
   * Thumb picking!
   * There's a lot of unspoken nuance here, even in he's simply playing quarter notes that follow the chord progression. For instance, he's lifting his fretting finger on the upbeat to create a rest rather than letting the note decay. All that's to say, there's a lot of style involved in creating even a relatively simple bassline.
   * How his fretting thumb comes up around the top of the fretboard as he reaches for the D and G strings
   * "You can do fiddly bits if you want" - Just absolutely love how he says that with a shrug. So great.
