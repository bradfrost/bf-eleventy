There is so much beautiful wisdom in this: [17 Life-Learnings from 17 Years of The Marginalian.](https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/22/17/?fbclid=PAAaYKmQyqC0BqPxT-6LVnNvPk0TRq4fDvkp6wWSe9-U6wy_-6Dc36OvR6X04_aem_Aadm9qg2F7yeeUG_M5sm0mBE-sK7IX-7kDJ2aOBF7xsOUxbzjT4zVWUKJF6J94TRpK4&s=03) I've been following Maria Popova for years, and have always love the way she's used hyperlinks to weave through lines across many voices, perspectives, and ages.
