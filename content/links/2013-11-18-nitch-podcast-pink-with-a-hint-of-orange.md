In this episode of the [Nitch](http://nitch.cc/podcast/episode-82-pink-with-a-hint-of-orange) podcast, [Kelli Shaver](http://kellishaver.com/) and [Jonathan Stark](http://jonathanstark.com/) talk about [Pattern Lab](http://pattern-lab.info/). Jonathan and I worked on [Entertainment Weekly](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/entertainment-weekly/) and [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/15/techcrunch-has-redesigned-again/) together, so he was able to share his perspective on Pattern Lab and how we used it in our process.
