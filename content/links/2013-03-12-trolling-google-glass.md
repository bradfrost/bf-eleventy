![Trolling Google Glass](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/troll.jpg) [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com/) and I were hanging out waiting to get into [Frank](http://hotdogscoldbeer.com/) last night when a bizarre group of people started crowding the sidewalk. It turns out it was for some Google Glass demo and a girl wearing the neato keen gadget was getting a lot of attention. Dave snapped [the picture](http://instagram.com/p/WvMQ9mnI-q/) and it somehow found its way onto [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3006879/google-glass-won-sxsw-who-cares) today. hahahahaha to trolling Google Glass. Sidenote: I am now a "SXSW Goer." Even more bizarre is that the photo made it onto its own site: [Embrace The Glass](http://embracetheglass.com/), courtesy of [Jason Beaird](http://jasongraphix.com/). And that was in response to [Embrace the Squishiness](http://embracethesquishiness.com/), which was put together by [Chris Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/). Oh, and throw the newly created [@fakebradfrost](https://twitter.com/fakebradfrost) Twitter handle onto the pile. My life is becoming a meme. Send help.
