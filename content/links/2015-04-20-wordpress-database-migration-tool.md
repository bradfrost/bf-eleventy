I just bought [WP Migrate DB Pro](http://t.deliciousbrains.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1284) to help keep my local databases and live sites in sync. Looking forward to digging into this. Right now my local sites and my live sites are way out of sync, and it can be really frustrating. I bought the developer version which includes media files in the mix, so that should definitely come in handy.
