Here's [Ian's recap of Frostapalooza](https://ianfrostweather.com/life/frostapalooza-reflecting-two-months-later/). 

> Folks didn’t just show up, but everyone was so kind and encouraging. It was never about them, it was about the show and how we could make it as fantastic as possible. The guitarists were amazing. The brass section was amazing. The keys were amazing. The bassists were amazing. The singers sounded amazing. The mandolins and banjos were amazing. The percussionists were amazing. The musical saw was amazing. How many shows have a musical saw?! What a night!
 
 It's fun to hear his perspective on the event as he was along for the whole ride. I knew the show would work largely in part because I knew I could count on Ian to hold it down on the drums the whole night. We've been playing music together for decades, and we've always been locked in. A sturdy rhythm section meant that all of the other people could sit on top of those solid foundations. So incredibly pleased how it all turned out. Now I just have to finish the mix and the video edits!
