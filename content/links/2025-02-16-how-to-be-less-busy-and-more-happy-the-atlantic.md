[How to Be Less Busy and More Happy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/busyness-boredom-happiness-worklife/678085/) is a great reminder about the busy busy busy waters we swim in. It's been a long journey to work at this in my own life, and it feels like it will never be a "solved" problem. It requires keeping busyness in check and being incredibly cognizant of how much I'm realistically able to bite off. If you need help with reframing your relationship to busyness, [Do Nothing by Celeste Headlee](https://celesteheadlee.com/do-nothing-book/) is well worth a read.
