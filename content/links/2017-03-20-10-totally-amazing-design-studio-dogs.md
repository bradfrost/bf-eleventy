Ziggy's been featured in a roundup of amazing studio dogs, and I couldn't be prouder. Here's what I have to say: 

> I work from home with my brother and my wife who runs her own business. Ziggy is the glue that holds the whole operation together. His snores contribute to conference calls, his gas clears rooms (it's his way of telling us we need to get up and stretch our legs), and his hilarious presence ensures there's never a dull moment in the office.
 
 If you want to follow along with Ziggy's ridiculousness, follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brad_frost/). ![Brad Frost with Ziggy the bulldog](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6snQqiKF8cVrxT9cmKTtUb-650-80.jpg)
