[Ian](http://twitter.com/frostyweather) wrote up some thoughts about how he came into the web industry. By way of being my brother, he had the concepts of modularity and atomic design beaten into him from Day 1 on the job. Perhaps he has a case of Stockholm syndrome, but maybe not. In his post he lays out some things he's learned from some of our recent projects, including how atomic design influences the design/development process and helps inform a sound frontend architecture.
