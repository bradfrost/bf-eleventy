A fantastic case study of [designing in the open](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/). The Guardian attributes a lot of its redesign success to the fact that they were open and sharing the whole way through. This is tremendously inspiring, especially coming from such a large organization. I hope others follow suit.
