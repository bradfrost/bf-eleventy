> Brad and Dave and I were sitting around after InControl talking about design patterns that hadn't been explored as much. Dave mentioned "Search with Filters" as an example. There can be quite a lot of UI involved in a search filter, so you have the challenge of displaying that without taking up too much room for the actual results, as well as allowing the user to change those filters without being too disruptive. 
 
 Here's the always-brilliant Chris Coyier with a solution to responsive search with filter options for responsive designs. I've added it to the [pattern library](http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/patterns.html).
