So this is hilarious. The [Chicago Sun-Times](http://www.suntimes.com/) website went live with placeholder content. Not just any placeholder content, but _my_ placeholder content! ![Chicago Sun-Times placeholder content](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sun-Times.png) I've been using the grayscale images for years now (on [This Is Responsive pattern demos](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html)), but added the dimensions for use in the [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) demo. Does that mean they're using Pattern Lab? If so, cool! They should probably keep it out of their live site though.
