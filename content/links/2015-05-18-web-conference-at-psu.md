I'm thrilled to be speaking at the [Web Conference at Penn State](http://webconference.psu.edu) alongside so many other great speakers (including apparently Tim Gunn of _Project Runway_ fame. Life achievement unlocked?). Registration closes in just a few days, so I'd look into snagging a ticket if I were you.
