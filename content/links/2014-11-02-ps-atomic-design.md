This is great. Diego Andrés Aranda runs through how to accomplish an [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) workflow in Photoshop. It's in Spanish, so [here's an English translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Foctuweb.com%2Fatomic-ps-design). From what I can gather, it's a matter of stitching together Smart Objects and organizing them in a certain way. There are only 4 levels: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and Pages. Templates are left out because Photoshop (or any other static environment) can't [design with dynamic data](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-with-dynamic-content/). Ultimately, I think [Creative Cloud Libraries](http://danielmall.com/articles/creative-cloud-libraries/) will be a nice enhancement for accomplishing an atomic design workflow in Photoshop. I think it's great to see designers working in Photoshop move toward crafting design systems in a smart way.
