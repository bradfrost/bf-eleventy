🎸 I had a [fantastic conversation](https://rss.com/podcasts/designdowntime/1535713/) with [Guy Segal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) on the [Design Downtime](https://rss.com/podcasts/designdowntime/) podcast about my love of playing music. We talked about: 
 
   * My musical background
   * The beauty and role of the bass guitar
   * The importance of [having hobbies for the hell of it](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/hobbies-for-the-hell-of-it/) and playing music simply for the joy of playing music
   * [Frostapalooza!](http://frostapalooza.com/) We talked about the big idea around
   * Some of my favorite bass players
