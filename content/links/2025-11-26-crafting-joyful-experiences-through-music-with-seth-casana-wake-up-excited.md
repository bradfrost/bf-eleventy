I'd love it if you [check it out](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/7) and consider [subscribing](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/subscribe) to the show! At first glance, [Seth Casana](https://sethcasana.com/) is a very unassuming, normal guy. But that all changes once he’s on stage. I’ve seen Seth belt out soulful funk wearing a moped helmet with bowling trophies duct taped to it. I’ve seen him rap while wearing samurai armor made from old computer keyboards. I’ve seen him marching down the street with [his brass band](https://elbybrass.com/) all wearing old high-school marching band uniforms. I’ve seen him marching around town with [a disco ball helmet and DJ rig strapped to him](https://walkingdisco.com/). Seth was my secret weapon at my big [Frostapalooza](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frostapalooza-one-epic-night/) concert. Not only did he supply his incredible band, [Elby Brass](https://elbybrass.com/), to be our horn section, Seth was our [Peter Gabriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywq_AHSynXY&list=PLRVyFmnlMfe23hoLs4Hg8PpSgJXP9qTGx&index=4), Bruno Mars, David Byrne, and Thom Yorke, equipped with a sousaphone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywq_AHSynXY&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe23hoLs4Hg8PpSgJXP9qTGx&index;=4  [In our conversation](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/7), Seth and I cover the power and potency of live music, the importance of shared joyful experiences, the arts as a professional vs as a practice, the immense effort that goes into creating fun experiences, the role of levity, humor, and whimsy in these bleak times, and practical tips for cultivating your creativity.
