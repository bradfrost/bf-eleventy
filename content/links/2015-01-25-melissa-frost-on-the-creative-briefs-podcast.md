My wife [Melissa](https://twitter.com/minifrost) appeared on AIGA Pittsburgh's Creative Briefs podcast, talking about launching her new jewelry studio, [Frost Finery](http://frostfinery.com/), working on the [Pittsburgh Food Bank's website](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/greater-pittsburgh-community-food-bank-open-redesign/) in the open, working on a redesign of [Time Inc.](http://www.timeinc.com/), and a whole lot more. I'm absolutely honored to call this woman my wife.
