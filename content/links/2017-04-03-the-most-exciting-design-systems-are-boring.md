I've had the extreme privilege of working with [Josh](https://bigmedium.com/) and [Dan](http://superfriend.ly/) on many pattern-based websites and design systems. In addition to getting into the weeds with our clients to help design and build the design systems themselves, a big part of our work often involves helping clients round up and curate all the smarts that's spread around the organization. Josh's post does a great job underscoring the fact that this kind of roundup isn't exactly sexy work, but it's necessary and has a big impact. Hooray for boring!
