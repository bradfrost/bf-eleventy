[This is awesome.](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/01/marina-kappos-paintings) Artist [Marina Kappos](https://marinakappos.com/) created a whole series of symmetrical paintings inspired by her relationship with her twin sister. ![an abstract painting of numerous semi-transparent layers of color, roughly outlining the profiles of faces, creating a prismatic optical effect](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kappos-5-960x962-1.jpg) This resonates with me as my mom is a twin. And is also an art teacher! But also! My sister created my twin nieces. My cousin (my mom's twin's son) had twins (a boy and a girl). I've been around twins my entire life, so I can certainly appreciate what Marina is saying here: 

> “In a peculiar way, I can relate to distant particles affecting one another because I have an identical twin sister,” she tells Colossal. “I have grown up with a mirrored reflection of myself, but one that is also independent and leading a different life than me. This unique perspective has created a lifelong bond of interconnectedness between my sister and me.”
