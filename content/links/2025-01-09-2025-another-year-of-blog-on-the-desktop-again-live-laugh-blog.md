> i really can't overstate how nice it is to have these old posts to go back to and remind me of all i've accomplished. my brain tends to default to forgetting my wins and replaying the fails, so going back to these posts have helped keep my brain honest. this should be your year to start a blog if you've not done so yet.
 
 HARD AGREE. [Jenn is describing](https://livelaugh.blog/posts/2025/) a phenomenon I've experienced many times over the [12 years of writing year-in-review posts](https://bradfrost.com/blog/tag/year-in-review/). Our [experiencing selves operate quite differently than our remembering selves](https://www.headspace.com/articles/remembering-vs-experiencing). Blogging/journaling encases our experiencing selves in amber, allowing us to revisit ourselves at a later date. I've found it incredibly helpful to revisit "here's what I did" and "here's what I'm excited about" year over year. It ends up telling a pretty powerful story; do my prior year's goals ("things I'm excited about!") align with the following year's reality ("things I got up to")? If they do align, fantastic! If they don't align, why not? At face value, this type of blogging feels just like barfing up a declarative list of events and sharing a few stray thoughts. But this writing unlocks a real opportunity to reflect on life and whether or not we're living in alignment with our values and enthusiasms. So yeah, blogging is awesome and I very much agree that 2025 is a great year to start a blog and share your thoughts with the world — and your future self! Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go write my 2024 year-in-review post.
