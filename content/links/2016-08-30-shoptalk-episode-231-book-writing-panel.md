I had the great opportunity to chat with Chris, Dave, Val, Simon, and Richard about what goes into writing a book. It was fun to hear some the other authors all talk through the same challenges I've had (like competing with work, clients, speaking, side projects, family, and a laundry list of other obligations). The panel also really validated my decision to self-publish and to write the whole thing in the open. I'm super happy with that decision. As always, you can [read my book](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) in its entirety and [preorder the final ebook](http://shop.bradfrost.com/collections/frontpage/products/atomic-design-ebook) to support the project.
