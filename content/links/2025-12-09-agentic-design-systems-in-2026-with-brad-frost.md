I'm super excited to [talk about the potent combination of AI and design systems](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/8817522434822/WN_iPyLHSR_S0uc5npmGjcr6A?utm_campaign=31323911-20251211_campaign_webinar-zoom_global-en_all-full-awareness_AgenticDesignSystems2026BradFrost&utm_content=360511283&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-74529112#/registration) with my pal [Dominic Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/domyen/) and the folks at [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) this Thursday. I got to huddle with Dom today, and this is something that's going to be pretty dang cool.

> AI is rapidly reshaping who (or what) uses your design system. Autonomous agents are assembling UIs with the same components your human teams use. That shift demands design systems evolve into machine-readable infrastructure—or risk becoming artifacts of a bygone era.
