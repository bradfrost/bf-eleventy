[Stephanie Walter](http://www.inpixelitrust.fr/) created some beautiful illustrations based on my post about [responsive design strategies](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/responsive-strategy/). I absolutely love the pooling water around the mobile screen in the retrofitting example, and love the layered shades of blue in the mobile-first example.
