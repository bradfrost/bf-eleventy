Despite the doom-and-gloom title, this is a good article explaining how important it is to settle on a vocabulary that makes sense for the team. I will say one thing in defense of the naming structure of [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Atoms, molecules, and organisms does have a built-in hierarchy to it. I'll discuss it further in [my book](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), but my issue with terms like "modules" and "components" is that they don't carry any sense of hierarchy, and become these amorphous clusters of interface.
