[Berit Hlubek](https://twitter.com/berit_jensen) created a fantastic deck about [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), and how to apply it to a real-world project. It's so great to see other people successfully using atomic design principles to create great work. Very inspiring.
