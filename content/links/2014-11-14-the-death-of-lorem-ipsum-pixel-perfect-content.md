[Dave Olsen](http://dmolsen.com/) ([@dmolsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen)) nails it. In his talk at [Confab EDU](http://confabevents.com/events/higher-ed/), Dave addresses the frustrations of our web design and development process, and how a pattern-driven workflow can help. Dave describes the many benefits of pattern-driven workflow: 
 
   * Patterns encourage communication between everyone involved in a project
   * Patterns establish a shared vocabulary between disciplines and stakeholders
   * Patterns force us to focus by breaking big problems 
   * Patterns makes testing more efficient
   * Patterns allow for reuse and extensibility
 
Dave drives home again and again how patterns can help teams work together and helps make everyone's lives either. Do yourself a favor and watch Dave's talk and check out his slides:
