> Being a fan is all about bringing the enthusiasm. It’s being a champion of possibility. It’s believing in someone. And it’s contagious. When you’re around someone who is super excited about something, it washes over you. It feels good. You can’t help but want to bring the enthusiasm, too. This, to me, is the real transformation. Confidence is impressive, but enthusiasm can change people’s lives.
 
 I love everything about Tina's article, [A Love Letter To The People Who Believe In People.](https://creativemornings.com/blog/a-love-letter-to-the-people-who-believe-in-people)

> In a world that sometimes feels like it’s waiting to discourage you, we need to find and become uplifting, optimistic, heart-forward people more than ever.
 
 HELL YES. This is the spirit behind [Wake Up Excited!](https://wakeupexcited.show/) and a lot of my other pursuits. It took a while to learn how to wield my enthusiasm constructively, but now that I have used it there's no going back.
