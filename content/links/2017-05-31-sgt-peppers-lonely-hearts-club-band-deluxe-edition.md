I've been listening on repeat to the outtakes, instrumentals, and unfinished tracks from the Sgt. Peppers recording sessions. I absolutely love hearing the rawness of the song ideas come through, and it's so much fun imagining what conversations they had to evolve the tracks into the finished album we all know. I love the [Song Exploder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band-deluxe-edition/id1229303803) podcast because it pulls the curtain back and exposes the process that leads to great music. I feel like this deluxe edition album is almost like a wonderful Song Exploder episode that involves a time machine. Hearing these unfinished ideas reminds me that even some of the best creative work humanity has ever produced didn't just fall from the sky. It's a process.
