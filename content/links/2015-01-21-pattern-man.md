Pattern Man is an atomic-design-style approach to [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), brought to you by those brainiacs at [Bearded](http://www.bearded.com/). I really like the nested include approach that allows you to keep your patterns [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), although I think I still very much prefer how [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) handles dynamic data. Keeping the structure and the data entirely separate has proved to be really helpful.
