During my [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) talk at [Smashing Conf in Whistler](http://smashingconf.com/whistler-2014/), I joked that adding images of Beyoncè to your designs is a surefire way of getting approval from clients. So [Chris Balt](https://twitter.com/chrisbalt) took the next logical step to come up with an image placeholder service that inserts a random image of Beyoncè into your designs. Well played. Let the design approvals commence!
