I'm really really really excited for [Artifact Conf](http://artifactconf.com/). I'm as excited as I was for the first [BDConf](http://bdconf.com/). Here's why. Before the first Breaking Conference, a lot of ridiculously smart people thinking about a lot of important things regarding the mobile web, but the ideas were scattered around in individual blog posts and mailing lists. That first BDConf event was the first time all those diverse thoughts converged in one place, and helped set the stage for a broader direction. The same thing is happening with regards to process and workflow in the responsive age. There are a ton of really innovative ideas out there, and I think this conference is going to do a lot to get it all out on the table so we can start to make a lot of these ideas coagulate. There are a ton of great speakers, and I'm going to be there doing a half-day workshop on [responsive web design patterns](http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/patterns.html). You can [register for the event here](https://account.unmatchedstyle.com/register/artifact-2013/). Hope to see you in Austin!
