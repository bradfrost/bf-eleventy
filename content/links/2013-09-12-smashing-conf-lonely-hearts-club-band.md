So these past few days/weeks have been pretty bizarre. Probably one of the most bizarre things that happened was playing Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band at a web conference with [Nishant](http://rainypixels.com/), [Dan](http://danielmall.com/) and [Dan](http://about.me/danrubin) at [Smashing Conference](http://smashingconf.com/) in Germany. Here's the video:  [Smashing Conf Lonely Hearts Club Band](http://vimeo.com/74242561) from [Besquare](http://vimeo.com/besquare) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).
