[The age of average (encore) by Alex Murrell](https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average-encore) is a wild analysis of how the technology landscape has changed the shape of music.  "Media has always shaped music," the author states, (David Byrne's [How Music Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Music_Works) is a wonderful book that digs into this idea), but this particular era has led to an interesting flattening of popular music.
