_[Opera introduces a new web browser: Opera Air - Blog | Opera News](https://blogs.opera.com/news/2025/02/opera-air-browser/)_

> Today we’re introducing [Opera Air](https://opr.as/opera-air-download), the first web browser built around the concept of mindfulness. With Opera Air we’re introducing a secure, powerful, and fully functional browser that is designed to make you feel better while you’re browsing the web. This new browser integrates calming, research-based mindfulness features such as breathing exercises, binaural beats, and inspiring positive quotes; they’re embedded into your browser so you can do mindfulness exercises without disrupting your daily routine
 
   I love the idea of products baking mental health and mindfulness into the fabric of software. Not just lip service, but explicit design principles backed up by real, tangible features. The things we create affects our users' wellbeing. Let's make that a real concern!
