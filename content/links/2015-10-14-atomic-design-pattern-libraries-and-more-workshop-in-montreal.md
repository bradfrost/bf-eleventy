I'm super excited to head to Montreal October 25th to give a [full-day workshop](http://dynamiclabs.io/atomic-design) all about [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), establishing effective [pattern libraries](http://styleguides.io/), [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), and working with a pattern-based workflow. There are only a few tickets available (maximum of only 30 people), which means we can actually get hands-on and have in-depth conversations. Grab a [ticket](http://dynamiclabs.io/atomic-design#tickets) and see ya there!
