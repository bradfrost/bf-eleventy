> I'll never forget the first time I heard this song (which was also my introduction to the band). It was played during the credits of an episode of Daria, and I was totally blown away. But this was before everything was a Google search away, and definitely before Shazaam/Soundhound. The moment was fleeting, and I still recall that frustrated feeling of having something truly unique and original slip away into a commercial break. It wasn't until sometime later (months? years?) that the track crossed my path again. This time I made certain not to let the name of the band slip by. After many years, many Napster/Kazaa/Limewire downloads, many CD purchases, and (only) one live show, Cake remains one of my absolute favorite bands. Thanks, Daria.
