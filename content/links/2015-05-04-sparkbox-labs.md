The fine folks at Sparkbox created a hub for all their little tools and documents they use in their process. Some of it's code, some of it's documentation, but it's all helpful. These resources (as well as [Filament Group's code hub](http://www.filamentgroup.com/www/)) look like a great way to brand community contributions and would certainly look attractive to potential employees. Really great stuff.
