[John Allsopp](https://twitter.com/johnallsopp)'s beautiful A List Apart article [A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) is turning 15. To celebrate, A List Apart asked folks to reflect on the John's wise words. Of course I submitted my thoughts too late (hey, that hole in the backyard isn't going to dig itself), so here's what I was going to say: 

> The Web's inherent flexibility allows us to create experiences that are interacted with in a multitude of screen sizes, devices, and environments. This key characteristic of the Web becomes more important and more apparent with each passing day. Thank you John for crystalizing the notion that the Web is a unique medium, and that in order to create for it, we must embrace its most powerful qualities
