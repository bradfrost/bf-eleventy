[This](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/05/cursor-party) by Matt Webb is easily one of the coolest and most creative bits of web design I've seen in a long time. It's a fantastic reminder that there's still so much room to explore and innovate on the web. It's also a fantastic reminder that all these years later, [development is design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/). Great ideas like this happen when technology is used as a design material and different disciplines are given the chance to actually collaborate with one another. That's why all these years later I'm still so incredibly passionate about fostering designer/developer collaboration. Facilitation of cross-disciplinary collaboration is such a core part of our work at [Big Medium](https://bigmedium.com/) and it gives me an immense sense of joy to help get designers and developers working more closely together.
