[Josh](https://bigmedium.com/) wrote about social buttons, and I agree. I always had a hunch that social buttons weren't super effective, and when asked for my opinion, I'd say that I thought they're crufty, probably don't get interacted with all that much, and don't usually positively contribute to the user experience ([Death to Bullshit](http://deathtobullshit.com/) and all that). By working with Josh on many of these client projects, I've gotten to see the hunch confirmed through data.
