Hooo boy, this is great! I had [a fantastic time on the ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/601) talking about the need for [a Global Design System](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/a-global-design-system.html). It was a great conversation with two people that I feel fundamentally _get it_ ; so it was great to be able to dig into the rationale, the details, what would be hard, etc. We also were able to talk about [Frostapalooza](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/), the big-ass benefit concert I'm throwing on August 17th. Chris and Dave will be performing at the show, and Chris did a good job [pitching it on the show](https://shoptalkshow.com/601/#t=58:08)! You should come! You can [get your tickets here](https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/16005F70D2B839CC).
