I wrote a post called [The Workshop and The Storefront](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/) that describes the difference between a design system design/development environment (worksshop) and style guide (storefront). These metaphors was born of the client projects I've been fortunate to work on with [Josh](https://bigmedium.com/), so it's fantastic he weighed in on this with his typical, unparalleled eloquence. 

> Too often, though, we see organizations try to force everything into one place. We see workshop pattern libraries trying to do double duty as a canonical design-system reference. Or on the other side, we see pattern libraries set up as static storefront references that live outside a useful working development environment. When these resources set up outside the workflow of designers and developers, they don’t get used, they get stale, they become irrelevant. Following the workshop/storefront model—and stitching the two together so that one feeds the other—has ensured that the design systems we create continue to be used, vital, dynamic.
