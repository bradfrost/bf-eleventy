On January 20th, 2017, the accessibility and Spanish translations of the White House website were removed. This [goes against](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-webs-responsibility-in-the-trump-era/) the open and inclusive nature of the web. Thankfully, there are grassroots efforts in place to translate the White House site into Spanish. If you know Spanish, please consider helping out.
