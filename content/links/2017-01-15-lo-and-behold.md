We just watched Werner Holzog's film, [_Lo and Behold_](http://www.loandbehold-film.com/), which discusses the cultural and societal effects of the Internet. It's a fascinating film that ponders things about our digital age that deserve to be pondered. It contains some rather cute moments that can be chocked up to the fact that the director [doesn't own a smartphone](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/emoji-advice-werner-herzog/) and doesn't spend all too much time on the Internet. I think that perspective results in an interesting film. The film also contains a _whole lotta_ Pittsburgh! Holy smokes. It was fantastic to see so many Pittsburgh-based technology initiatives featured: from self-driving cars to disaster-preventing robots to brainwaves as input. It's really cool to watch a documentary that features groundbreaking work that's happening right down the street from your house.
