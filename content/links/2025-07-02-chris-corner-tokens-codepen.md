I like [Chris waxing on design tokens](https://blog.codepen.io/2025/06/30/chris-corner-tokens/) and am glad [our Shop Talk Show appearance](https://shoptalkshow.com/670/) gave some food for thought. While not every organization is wrestling with a [Multi-All-The-Things](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-multi-all-the-things-organization/) situation, every website and app can benefit from even a lightweight token architecture. It's the same way every website and app can benefit from components even if you don't need to create something comprehensive and formal like Lightning Design System.
