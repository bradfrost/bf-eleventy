I just sent out the second edition of the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) newsletter, where I'm posting progress on the book as well as resources related to style guides and pattern libraries. If you're interested, you can [sign up here](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/signup/). You can also check out the [first edition](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6c0c3f4dcd40d88bc1cedb3fa&id=25eb2d93e6), where I talk about how I'm setting up the website and am planning to post progress. Thanks!
