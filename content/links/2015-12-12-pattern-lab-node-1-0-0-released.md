[Brian Muenzenmeyer](http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/) ([@bmuenzenmeyer](https://twitter.com/bmuenzenmeyer)) has done a fantastic job of bringing [Pattern Lab Node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) to life, and it's now officially in 1.0 status. Brian [wrote about](http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/pattern-lab-node-1-0-0-released/) what's changed, and I'm exciting to see things moving forward! Speaking of moving forward, [Dave Olsen](http://twitter.com/dmolsen) is working hard on the next version of Pattern Lab PHP. I've been using the [development edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-development) on a few projects, and it's been smooth sailing thus far. I'm super pumped. There's a lot of architectural changes to make it all more flexible, and I'm really excited to see where it goes from here. And lastly, [Ian](http://ianfrostweather.com/) and I are working on finishing the new version of the [Pattern Lab site.](http://patternlab.io/) I feel with the Node version taking off and the new version of the PHP version approaching, it's probably a good idea to give the site a facelift. So lots of Pattern Lab-related things to look forward to!
