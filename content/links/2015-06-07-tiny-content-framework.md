> This is a [tiny content strategy framework](http://www.swellcontent.com/2012/03/framework/) focused on goals, messages, and branding. This is not a checklist. Use what you need and scrap the rest.

 A wonderful guide from [Nicole Fenton](http://nicoleslaw.com/) for kickstarting an effective content strategy.
