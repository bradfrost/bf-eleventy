I was not aware of this site, but it's been floating around in light of the recent awful news that Betsy DeVos made it in as Secretary of Education. Here's what Donors Choose is about: 

> We make it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education.
 
 Sounds fantastic. My mom is an art teacher, and for my entire life I've watched her reach into her own pocket to pay for supplies so that her students would be able to have a decent arts education. I think it's fantastic there's a service to help real teachers who want to give their students the best education possible.
