I had a wonderful time talking with Justin Avery about all sorts of topics around responsive web design. I could talk to that guy all day! I'm also super impressed by all the progress he's made on the [Responsive Design Is](http://responsivedesign.is/) website. It's a fantastic resource, so be sure to check it out.
