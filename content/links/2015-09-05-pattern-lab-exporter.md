[Pam Griffith](http://pamgriffith.net/) created a script to migrate patterns from inside of Pattern Lab into a CMS. She [wrote a post](http://pamgriffith.net/blog/experimenting-with-pattern-libraries/) explaining a bit more about the project: 

> So I’ve been playing with making a conversion script that takes the patterns from Pattern Lab and converts it for a couple of different content management systems I use. So far I have it working for[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and [Statamic](http://statamic.com/); I have tried but failed to get it working in[Perch](https://grabaperch.com/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) because some of the things that need to be done in those environments is difficult to automate based on the Mustache templates that Pattern Lab uses.
 
 So awesome to see people extending Pattern Lab and molding it to their needs. This is especially cool as [Dave](http://dmolsen.com/) and I are working towards making Pattern Lab more flexible so more people can integrate it with their CMSes.
