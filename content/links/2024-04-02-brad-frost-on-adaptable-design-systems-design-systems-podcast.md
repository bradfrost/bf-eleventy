I had a great chat with Chris Strahl on the[ Design Systems Podcast](https://www.designsystemspodcast.com/episodes/episode/81b5085b/106-brad-frost-on-adaptable-design-systems), and we covered a lot of ground! 

> We sit down with Brad Frost, a leading voice in design systems. Together, we explore the critical intersection between adaptable design systems and brand identities, unveiling the secrets to creating components that not only function seamlessly across platforms but also resonate with diverse brand aesthetics. Listen in as we discuss the layers of a successful design system, from global frameworks to the 'recipes' that define specific use cases, and highlight the importance of industry-wide component standardization. This thought-provoking conversation with Brad Frost promises to elevate your approach to design systems.
