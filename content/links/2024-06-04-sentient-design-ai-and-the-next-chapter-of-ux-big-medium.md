[This is an absolute must-read/watch](https://bigmedium.com/speaking/sentient-design-josh-clark-talk.html) for any designer or design leader navigating this wild new AI world.  [Josh Clark](https://bigmedium.com/about/josh-clark.html) is second to none at demystifying this new crop of technologies, demonstrating how to wield AI as a design material, and thoughtfully balancing opportunity & optimism with skepticism & care. I'm so incredibly lucky to have a front-row seat to hear his thinking on these topics (and many others!), and it's because of Josh that I've been able to resist my own urges to merely react to the constant AI hype cycle with all-or-nothing thinking or knee-jerk reactions. Josh frames things so thoughtfully and really helps separate the wheat from the chaff. I'm so thankful for his perspective. Josh and Veronika Kindred are transforming these ideas into a forthcoming book called _Sentient Design_ published on Rosenfeld Media. I'm so excited to see it come to life!
