OMG, this is such great news! My favorite newsletter [Sidebar is back from its break.](https://uxdesign.cc/sidebar-is-back-from-its-break-af1a4280385c) Designer [Fabricio Teixeira](https://fabricio.work/) is taking over the duties. He explains the spirit of Sidebar: 

> **Sidebar has always felt different.** It has advocated for a healthier web ecosystem and has always prioritized links pointing to small, curated digital gardens around the web. Links that come from the makers and doers out there. Sidebar was a signal boost for the kind of web I think many of us miss. A web built by individuals, not algorithms. It championed the small, the curated, the personal. I’ve always seen Sidebar as a force of resistance or sorts. Built for people who still believe in the web as a platform for knowledge sharing, long-form writing, and community.
 
 I agree, which is why [I too was heartbroken](https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/sidebar-is-taking-a-break/) when Sacha announced he was taking a break from diligently publishing the newsletter for over 12 years. So yeah! If you love a no-bullshit newsletter that publishes 5 daily links about design and the web, [subscribe to Sidebar here](https://sidebar.io/).
