A while back I wrote about the [concept of project hubs](http://24ways.org/2013/project-hubs/) for 24 Ways. I'm thrilled to see people finding the concept of a simple timeline for project milestones useful, and am even more thrilled to see tools emerge to make project hubs easy to set up and manage. Gunther Groenewege created a tool called Kirby Project Hub, which uses the lightweight CMS to create and manage project hubs. I'm excited to check it out!
