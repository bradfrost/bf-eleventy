> We print out page designs, hand them some scissors, and get them to [cut up the pages](https://adactio.com/notes/9015) into their smallest components. Mix them all up so you can’t even tell which components came from which pages.
 
 I really like this workshop exercise idea from [Charlotte](http://www.lottejackson.com/) and [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/). I do something similar in my company workshops with my [interface inventory exercise](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/conducting-an-interface-inventory/), but I have everyone screenshot their existing sites or new designs. The tangible nature of printing something out and chopping it up definitely seems like an effective way to sell people on a pattern-based design and development workflow.
