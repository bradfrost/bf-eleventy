Great post by [Bret Jankord](https://twitter.com/bjankord) about the meaning of popular terms that get flung around a lot: progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, [Mobile First](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/the-many-faces-of-mobile-first/), responsive web design, RESS and more. This clarification is extremely welcome as I see a whole lot of misuse out there.
