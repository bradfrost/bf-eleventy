[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMqSjWfCzqs[/embed] I'm obsessed with [this song](https://emefe.bandcamp.com/track/sun-spat) by [EMEFE](https://emefemusic.squarespace.com/); the build, the motif, and how it ultimately locks in is absolutely incredible. I'm diving into more of their music, but this is amazing.
