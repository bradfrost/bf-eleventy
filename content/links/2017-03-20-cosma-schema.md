My friend [Andrew Sloan](http://sloan.al/) is amazing. Not too long we were at a friend's wedding and he was talking about how he was creating a fictitious design agency for space companies. He printed some business cards and started chatting with commercial space companies at an expo, and started having some great conversations. I encouraged him to put together a site and start talking about it. Now, in true fake-it-til-you-make-it fashion, he's blowing up all over [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14888232/cosma-schema-private-space-industry-branding-graphic-design) and [Wired Germany](https://www.wired.de/collection/design/andrew-sloan-designer-weltraum-space-interview) after speaking about design at a commercial space conference in Berlin. Never underestimate the power of having the courage to run with your ideas.
