PSD To Wordpress asked me what 3 web development tools I couldn't live without. Here's what I had to say: 

>   1. [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) While I'm a bit biased, I honestly can't imagine designing websites without Pattern Lab. It gives me the ability to establish and implement design patterns, [design with dynamic content](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-with-dynamic-content/), and craft a pattern library alongside the final product. Again, I'm biased, but I legitimately love it.
  2. [jQuery](http://jquery.com) While the footprint is sizable, jQuery takes a lot of the grunt work out of Javascript writing. Because I've used it so long I would have a hard time giving it up
  3. [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) Developer tools have definitely made my life a lot easier. While I certainly am no power user, the ability to modify things on the fly, see what's been downloaded, etc, are massively beneficial.
