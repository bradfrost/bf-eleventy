It's so wonderful to see teams using [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) to launch successful projects. In fact, it makes me a little teary-eyed. In this case, the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) team used Pattern Lab to create an interface design system for their snazzy new responsive site. The team rolled a bunch of their tools up into a nice package they're calling [Daisy](https://github.com/HBRGTech/daisy), which includes Pattern Lab, Grunt, Foundation, and more. [Daigo Fujiwara](https://twitter.com/daigofuji) wrote more about their process, Pattern Lab, and Daisy [over on his blog](http://www.daigo.org/2014/11/introducing-daisy-a-sasspattern-lab-workflow-solution-using-vagrant/). I'm absolutely thrilled to see teams sharing their process and their tools like this. Great work!
