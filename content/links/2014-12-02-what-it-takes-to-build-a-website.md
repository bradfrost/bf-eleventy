[Drew McClellen](http://allinthehead.com/), creator of the wonderful [24 Ways](http://24ways.org/about/) project, kicked off this year's calendar with a great post about what it takes to make a website in this day in age. Drew asked a few people's opinions on the topic, so here's my two cents: 

> For me, teams making websites in 2015 shouldn’t be working on just-another-redesign redesign. People are realizing that in order to make stable, future-friendly, scalable, extensible web experiences they’re going to need to think more systematically. That means crafting deliberate and thoughtful [design systems](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). That means establishing [front-end style guides](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/). That means killing the out-dated, siloed, assembly-line waterfall process and getting cross-disciplinary teams working together in meaningful ways. That means treating [development as design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/). That means treating [performance as design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/performance-as-design/). That means taking the time out of the day to establish the big picture, rather than aimlessly crawling along quarter by quarter.
