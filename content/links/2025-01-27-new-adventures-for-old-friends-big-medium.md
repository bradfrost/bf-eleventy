[Josh wrote up a really sweet send-off](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/new-adventures-for-old-friends.html) for me, Ian, and Jessi as [we embark on a new chapter of work and life](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/announcement-im-going-independent/). I share Josh's bittersweet sentiment: 

> It’s an end of an era for sure! [Bittersweet](https://grateful.org/resource/bittersweet-emotions-lifes-beauty/) is such a weird and complex emotion, and I’m allowing myself to feel all the weirdness and complexity. But I  _do_ know how grateful I am to Josh for all he’s done for me. I  _do_ know how grateful I am for Jessi, Kevin, Veronika, Abby, Sam, TJ, and all of our other collaborators. I  _do_ know how grateful I am for all of the clients who welcomed us into their worlds and trusted us to help them grow and evolve. I’m so incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished together over the years, and these vast and varied experiences will continue to shape my work and life.
 
 Long and deep relationships inevitably go through different seasons, and this new chapter is a new season for our relationship. Even though I'll see Josh on Zoom, I'm already looking forward to catching up in person over a drink.
