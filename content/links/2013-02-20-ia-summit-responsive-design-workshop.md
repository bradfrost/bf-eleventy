I'll be doing a full-day [responsive web design workshop](http://2013.iasummit.org/program/workshops/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-responsive-design-and-less/) at [iA Summit](http://2013.iasummit.org/) in Baltimore on April 3rd. I'm super excited to dive in deep to a lot of the challenges around responsive design, and I'm also super excited to see the stellar line-up, which includes smarties [Scott Jenson](http://jenson.org/) and [Karen McGrane](http://karenmcgrane.com/).
