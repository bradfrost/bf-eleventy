[Webdagene](http://webdagene.no/en/) is an absolutely phenomenal conference. This year they went all out and held the conference at the massive [Oslo Spektrum](http://www.oslospektrum.no/). I had the pleasure to [give a workshop](https://bradfrost.com/speaking/), give a talk about [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), _and_ close out the conference talking about being more [open](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/creative-exhaust/). Here's the video:  And the slides: http://www.slideshare.net/webdagene/brad-frost-atomic-design-2014
