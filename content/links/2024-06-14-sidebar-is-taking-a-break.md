[Sidebar is taking a break](https://sidebar.io/break/). 😭 Ah man, this makes me so sad. Sidebar has been my number 1 way to keep up to speed with the web, design, and beyond for the last decade. I love it so much. 5 links a day. Short, sweet, relevant, and direct. A healthy blend of practical stuff and big picture thinking, design and dev, web and other. [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/), thank you so incredibly much for your tireless work over the years. Some company should step in and sponsor Sidebar so the time and energy is worth your while. In the meantime, I hope you're able to enjoy a well-deserved break. Thanks for everything.
