I helped build the new [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/) site, along with a fantastic group of people: [Josh Clark](http://globalmoxie.com/index.shtml), [Jennifer Brook](https://twitter.com/jenniferbrook), [Dan Mall](http://danielmall.com/), [Jonathan Stark](http://jonathanstark.com/). and markup/CSS help from [Pon Kattera](http://pon.kattera.com/). I'll be writing a lot more about the process and the redesign soon.
