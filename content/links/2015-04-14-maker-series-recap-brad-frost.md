I had a fantastic time traveling to nearby Dayton OH to talk about [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) as part of [Sparkbox's](http://seesparkbox.com/) [Build Right: Maker Series](http://buildright.io/maker-series/2015/brad-frost). It was a really fun day largely in part because the Sparkbox crew set it up to be really casual and organic. Sure I talked for a while, but a large part of the day was dedicated to Q&A; and conversation. It was a blast. They have a [whole bunch of other events](http://buildright.io/maker-series/) coming up, and I would highly recommend attending them. They even have a season pass so you can attend a whole slew at a discount. Also, the illustration they did reminds me of Gorillaz, which I think is amazing: ![Brad Frost Gorillaz 2D](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/brad-gorillaz.jpg)
