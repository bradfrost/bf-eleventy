Well [this](https://medium.com/@zoiwrites/why-every-ux-ui-designer-should-attend-a-masterclass-with-brad-frost-b60e55315fa7) is just a really nice piece of flattery, and a nice breakdown of my design system masterclass I delivered at [HATCH Conference](https://www.hatchconference.com/) in Berlin last year. I truly enjoy teaching masterclasses, running workshops, and working with teams to help people understand important concepts, provide resources, and share my own experience working with dozens of teams on design system efforts. Thanks Zoi!
