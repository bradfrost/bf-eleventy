We cover a ton of ground! 
 
   * What “good” means in the age of AI and the real role of a designer
   * Practical advice on transitioning to a new design system
   * Why “component-by-component” rollouts backfire
   * How to ensure design system effort connects to real product value
   * Brad’s thoughts on issues with handoffs and collaboration in general
   * Bonus: high-level intro to tokens and Brad’s new Subatomic course
