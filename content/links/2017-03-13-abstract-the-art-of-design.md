PSA: this series on Netflix is really good. Each episode highlights a designer in a particular field (illustration, architecture, set design, etc). The subject talks about their work, their process, and their journey, and the whole thing is incredibly well produced. I love series like this (the podcast [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/) also comes to mind) because it removes a lot of the mystery behind the creative process. There's no magic, just a lot of hard work, happy accidents, and perseverance. We're only a few episodes in, but we especially loved the [Es Devlin](http://esdevlin.com/) episode.
