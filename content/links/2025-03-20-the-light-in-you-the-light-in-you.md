My friend Eva Lin Douglass wrote a beautiful children's book: _[The Light in You](https://www.thelightinyoubook.com/shop/p/beni-shoga-cs9gc). _ [![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot2025-03-17at9.51.07E280AFPM.png)](https://www.thelightinyoubook.com/shop/p/beni-shoga-cs9gc)

> Deep within you is a very special spark. It's a Light you are born with that never goes dark.
 
 If there's a message kids (and let's face it, adults) need to here more of, this is it.
