The fine folks at Happy Cog have a nice discussion about Post-PSD, pattern-driven process. And it's super great to hear that the work we've been doing with [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) has been inspirational for them. 

> ...the kind of stuff that Brad Frost and those guys are doing has been a really big inspiration to what we’re iterating on here. 
 
 Hooray! I have a great deal of respect for the Happy Cog people, so that makes me happy.
