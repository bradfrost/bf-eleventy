This book was fantastic. It contains a lot of practical advice about songwriting, but a lot of the advice can be applied to any creative endeavor. I love that he continually repeats that it's about the process rather than the product. There will be good and bad songs, but the magic is really about getting lost in music and creating something that didn't exist before. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in doing creative things.
