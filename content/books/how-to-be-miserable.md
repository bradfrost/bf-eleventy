The book's premise is interesting: "here's what to do to maximize your misery" in order to better understand how to live a happy life. Unfortunately, the book toggles between "here's how to be happy" and "here's how to be miserable" and it takes a lot of effort to figure out where the author's being facetious vs being sincere. It's also way over the self-help line for me and doesn't have enough psychological meat behind it.
