This book is incredible and spoke directly to me. It's aimed at driven, successful, overachiever, workaholic types, and helps shine some serious light on the traps and detrimental aspects of being wired for "doing" all the time. Do Nothing is one of most important books I've read and has truly helped me in my quest to reshape my life to be more balanced. I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone.
