Through deprogramming myself from my Catholic upbringing, I ended up being pretty skeptical about any faith tradition. However, through my wife, I've been getting into Buddhism, which I've learned is far more a philosophy than an organized religion. This book ticks all my boxes: the intersection between modern psychology, morality, mental health, and ancient philosophies. The book's title is a bold claim, and one that the author doesn't make lightly. But there's a lot of meat to back it up! The book explains how modern psychology and neuroscience backs up the core tenets of Buddhism.
