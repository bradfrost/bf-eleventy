Hats off to Dave Rupert for recommending this to me. At the time we were in desperate need of some optimism, and this book delivered. The premise is "maybe human beings aren't bad." And goes on to demonstrate the many ways that human beings are generous and altruistic by nature. My only criticism is that I feel the book doesn't do enough to really address the fact that while yes humans are good their are many power structures and forces at play to pit people against each other.
