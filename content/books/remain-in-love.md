I love the Talking Heads, so this book was right up my alley. Lots of great stories and memories, and the fact that Frantz was raised in Pittsburgh (in fact, in the very neighborhood where I now reside) made it that much more fun to read. His writing style is a bit declarative, but the story itself is great. I'd recommend it for any Talking Heads fan.
