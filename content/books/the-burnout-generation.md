This audiobook (sorta kinda a podcast but I'm going to classify it as a book) is a follow up to the author's article How Millennials Became The Burnout Generation. It interviews millennials who have experienced burnout that is all-too-common in our generation. Many of the stories really resonated with me, and I'm realizing that my own burnout is something that is worth examining a lot closer.
