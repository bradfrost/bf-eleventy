I live right by the Rachel Carson trail and really wanted to read this critical classic. But I'm learning that I don't have the stomach to read about the environment. This is now the third book that I had to stop reading because it brings me face to face with my deepest fear. I know one day I will confront that fear, but I need to be in a better/stronger headspace before I do that.
