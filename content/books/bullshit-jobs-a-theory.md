A fantastic book that discusses the phenomenon of bullshit jobs: jobs that shouldn't exist. Q: How do we know they shouldn't exist? A: The people who work these jobs say they shouldn't exist. This is a fantastic read about the effects capitalism has society. It supports artificially propping up jobs that people shouldn't have to do in the name of keeping busy and making money. This book gets to the heart of why it's a bad idea to tie work and worth together.
