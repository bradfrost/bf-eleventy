Yet another FIRE book. This one gets really hard into the plumbing of investment approaches and all of that, but it was good to reinforce a lot of the philosophies I've read in other FIRE books. And I'm also a big fan of the phrase "fuck you money", which is a very empowering concept. It sometimes got a bit too wonky for my tastes, but generally this was a good book.
