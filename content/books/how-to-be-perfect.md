This book accomplishes the amazing feat of being both substantive and hilarious. The Good Place is an incredible show, and this book serves as a deeper dive into a lot of the concepts explored in the show. It covers how some of the most important western philosophies help us (or not) as we navigate life in these challenging modern times. I love so many aspects of this book: the examples are relatable (I need the barista _see_ me tip them 27 cents so I can feel good about myself) and the hilarious translation of dense philosophical concepts into something that feels actionable. It rang all my bells and I'd highly recommend this to anyone.
