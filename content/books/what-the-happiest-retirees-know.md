This book outlines some qualities shared by fulfilled retired people. It was an interesting  read as someone in his 30s, as it helped frame a "skate where the puck is going" kinda mentality in me. But ultimately, the insights are are bit obvious: have interests, have strong relationships, don't have kids who mooch off of you, etc.
