I'm someone who actively avoids most digital things. But this book paints a picture of a renaissance of certain physical mediums (records, moleskine journals, polaroids, etc) in this increasingly digital age. I was expecting more of a "remember the good ol' days?" read and was pleasantly surprised that wasn't the case.
