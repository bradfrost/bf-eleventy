A great deep dive into creating intuitive, accessible forms. The 10 chapters cover form best practices through the lens of some real-world examples. Chapter 3 covers a flight booking form, which is especially convenient as one of my current clients is an airline! The author has a tendency to swat down anything new/shiny/fancy, but I'll say I'm usually that person as well (at least when it comes to form design).
