A fantastic primer on many of the ways our brains deceive us and don't optimize for human happiness and fulfillment. Our brains constantly think about the future, are high alert for threats, fill in the blanks on incomplete experiences, and make all manner of assumptions. Becoming aware of the various ways our brains play tricks on us doesn't stop them from playing trips on us! But the book outlines ways to short-circuit and counter some of their dirty tricks.
