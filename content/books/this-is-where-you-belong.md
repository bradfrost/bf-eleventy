This is a book that analyzes the criteria in which people decide where they want to live. Things like proximity to family, access to nature, visual aesthetics, and so on are discussed. But there some weird detours and an over-reliance on anecdotes and individual stories that had me scratching my head a bit. But in general, it was a good book that got me and my wife thinking about what we care about when it comes to finding our next place to live.
