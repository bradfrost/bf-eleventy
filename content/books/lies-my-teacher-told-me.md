Basically "A People's History of the United States" but told through the lens of school history textbooks. The author goes into detail about how school textbooks whitewash and sanitize American history in order dodge confronting our country's rocky history. There's a good deal about history's injustices to be learned here, as well as great criticisms of American pedagogy.
