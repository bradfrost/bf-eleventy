"Less, but better." is the gist of this book. This book is about increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in our lives, so we're able to focus on the most important things. This book, Do Nothing, and 4000 Weeks read back-to-back-to-back have helped steer me towards a more balanced life. This one isn't as much of an anti-productivity book as both 4000 Weeks and Do Nothing are, but the message is about reduction as a means of living a more fulfilling life.
