Kid A is one of my favorite albums of all time, and was in a lot of ways my real introduction to Radiohead. So I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which really paints the picture of how this album — a real sharp-left turn from the band's anticipated trajectory — came to be. It gets into the music landscape at the time, how the album was recorded, how it was received, and its lasting legacy. A great read for any Radiohead fan.
