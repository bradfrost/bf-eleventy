I _like_ Foo Fighters alright, but I've always _loved_ Dave Grohl as a human being. That sentiment is even truer now that I've read his book. A lot of his personality really resonates with me: true blue, funny, energetic, unapologetically optimistic, grateful, and sentimental. He's a fantastic role model and is a hilarious storyteller. If you're looking for really fun rock-and-roll lifestyle stories and some heartwarming inspiration, this book is for you.
