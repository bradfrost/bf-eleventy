I was simultaneously excited and terrified to read this book. I've long known my relationship with sleep has been less than ideal (to put it lightly). Sure enough, this book delivered and simultaneously got me excited about revolutionizing my relationship with sleep while also terrifying me about the damage I've already done to my body with my past poor sleep habits. People have sent me some criticism of the book and some of its specifics, and while I know a lot more research needs to be done I think the overall gist of "better sleep = better health" seems uncontroversial.
