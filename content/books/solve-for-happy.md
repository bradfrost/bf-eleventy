A look at happiness from someone who tragically lost their son due to an error during surgery. The happiness equation Mo lays out is Happiness is greater than or equal to your perception of the events in your life minus your expectations of how life should behave. While there were definitely good insights in the book, it's largely a repackaging of old principles (especially Buddhist ones). Also, in the last chapter he goes all-in on intelligent design, which I felt was really out of place and undermines the rest of the book.
