Great reminder that our work environments don't have to be stress factories. Something I need to remind myself of a lot. Probably my biggest takeaway from this book is that even if I tell my team to not work too hard (which I say frequently), they see me running around like crazy. So I'm not being a good example. There are lots of practical takeaways in here and I think it's worth reading.
