A fantastic read about how our over dramatic and negative outlook on the world prevents us from seeing (and therefore recognizing and celebrating) all the progress that's been made in the world. The book deconstructs why we get things so wrong about pretty important aspects of human life (such as stats about extreme poverty, global health, etc), and why things are in fact a lot better than the media leads us on about. But this isn't a "hey let's just feel good" book; it recognizes the severity of these issues, and explains how it's essential to hold two thoughts simultaneously in our heads: things are both "bad" and "better" at the same time. Of course important work needs to be done to address the big issues our world faces, but the authors claim that it's tough to do that when we are only alarmist about issues and don't accurately track the data and report on progress that's been made. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone.
