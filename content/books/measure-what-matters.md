I think OKRs are a helpful tactic, but I really struggled with a lot of the silicon valley mentality & lingo throughout the book.  Stuff like "push ourselves", "stretching","achieve 10x success". I'm just like "nah that sounds exhausting." It's good to have goals, define tactics, and to be able to measure your progress towards achieving your goals. But I bristle at the whole "do this to achieve 10x growth and ScAlE" mentality.
