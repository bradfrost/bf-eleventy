I eventually had to put this book down. Despite many quotes and nods towards brilliant and inspirational financial minds, none are attributed to women. I know the field of finance is male-dominated, but, like, could you _try_? Literally the only reference to a woman is a hypothetical investor.  Beyond the complete omission of women, there's also not a ton of real psychology in this book. I'd love to read a neuroscience/psychology book about money, but this ain't it.
