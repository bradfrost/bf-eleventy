Zeynep Tufekci is my favorite journalist. Whether she's discussing COVID, politics, or the Arab Spring, she's able to cut through the noise and shine a light on the systems and power structures at play. This book does a phenomenal job at dissecting how the internet has unlocked new ways for social movements to coordinate and collaborate. It also covers how power structures wield that same internet to counter social movements. A must read.
