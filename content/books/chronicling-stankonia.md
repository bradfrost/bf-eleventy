I love the concept and really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it wasn't very well written in my opinion. The book explores southern Black culture through the lens of southern rap, especially Outkast's seminal album, Stankonia. The writing style cherry picked lyrics from various songs and wrote a bunch of analysis that felt forced and a bit grabby. Again, I love the concept, but I wish the execution was a bit better.
