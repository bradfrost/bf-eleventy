I agree with pretty much everything in this book, and I'm glad I read it. I've been running my business as an intentionally small, nimble company and increasingly balk at the notion that "growth is good". While I very much agree with the message, I have a hard time with books that seem to be nothing but aggregates of examples and research. Every sentence was either "according to so and so" or "this company did this", which for me ends up being super tedious.
