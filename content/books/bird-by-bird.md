Anne Lamott's writing style is extremely funny and colorful. Even if you're not an aspiring fiction writer (which is who this book is directly aimed at), Bird By Bird shares some powerful messages around creativity, purpose, life, and productivity. Some of the core messages that will stay with me after reading this are: make creativity a habit, practice that habit daily, and the act of creation is itself fulfilling. There's some fantastic self-deprecating humor on display here, and it was a really fun read because of the pictures she paints with words.
