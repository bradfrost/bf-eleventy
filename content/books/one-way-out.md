A book about the history of the Allman Brothers Band. I love reading music books, and it was wonderful to read about a staple American band. Duane Allman was one of the best, and it sounds like he really was an amazing leader that created strong bonds around playing music. While it was fun to learn about the band's genesis, the format of the book is interview snippets from the band, crew, and constellation of people around the band. That means that the same thing is said 7 times by 7 people. In addition to the redundancy, the band has had a 40+ year career, but not all of it was as exciting or noteworthy as the formative years. But those years are giving equal weighting. I don't give a shit about some guitar player that stood in for a gig in 1992, but it's given the full treatment. I'd recommend reading the first part of this book to get the origin story, and then leaving it be after that.
