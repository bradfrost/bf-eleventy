My wife and I have been through some serious shit over the last year, so we have been doing some active work to make sure our relationship is as strong as possible. We did some couples counseling which has been absolutely phenomenal, and the counselor recommended this book. We listened to the book together, and it's already helped our relationship immensely. Highly recommended for any couple.
