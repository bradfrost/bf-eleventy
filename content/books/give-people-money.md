This is a great primer on universal basic income. I followed along and generally agree with all the arguments the author provided, especially since many of those arguments are backed up with data from real-world UBI trials. That said, I continue to have so many questions about the viability of enacting a universal basic income. Those questions have multiplied as the Great Resignation has manifested and so many employers are struggling to find workers.
