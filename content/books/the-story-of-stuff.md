I wavered on whether to give this 3.5 stars or 4 because I found the tone to be borderline insufferable. The format of the book is "Here's this terrible thing corporations do. And can you believe people don't care about it? But here's what _I_ do about it and if we all did what I do we'd save the world." That said, the book is incredibly substantive and gets at a lot of the core issues with consumerism, capitalism, power dynamics, and issues with waste management. For that reason I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone who cares about the planet we all live on.
