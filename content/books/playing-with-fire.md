This was a good book for me to read as I go down the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) rabbit hole. Vicki Robbin's book was a great introduction, and this book is a nice personal journey of someone in a similar life situation as me (mid-30s, young family, etc). It's more a narrative but also contains some good tips and how-to guides as well.
