This book was exactly what I needed. Far from a "just delete Facebook!" screed, it's a deep, thoughtful book about examining many things I've been struggling with. The book talks about how the design of our physical and digital worlds are geared towards optimizing our consumption and comfort. Because of this, "doing nothing" actually requires a hell of a lot of effort. The author urges us to connect with our physical world and to focus on what's _real_ in our lives. The book intentionally meanders around, exploring concepts of time, place, responsibility, politics, psychology, and more. This review doesn't do it justice at all; just read it for yourself and you won't be disappointed.
