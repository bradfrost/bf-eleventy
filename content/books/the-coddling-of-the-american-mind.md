Jonathan Haidt's other books were some of the best books I've read. This book, while good, doesn't compare to the others. The book dives into the cultural shift towards "safetyism" on college campuses and society at large. The mentality that people are fragile who need to be protected has led to kids not being able to play by themselves outside and controversial speakers being dis-invited from speaking on campuses. There's definitely some good thoughts in here, but there's also something about  two white men speaking to grievances expressed by people of color and other underrepresented groups.  But ultimately, I enjoyed the message of reducing tribalism and treating each other as capable, "anti-fragile" human beings that have value.
