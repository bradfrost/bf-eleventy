If this was the first book I read about FIRE, I'd likely give it a higher rating, but this read as three white dudes going over the same basic material covered in other books. I also have a hard time with people who worship at the altar of Tim Ferriss, so a lot of the content around side hustles and such were a bit grating for me.
