I was expecting this book to be more of a money tips book, but I was pleasantly surprised it was far more philosophical. While it contains a lot of tangible advice (it's a step-by-step program that I hope to do one day), the main thing it did for me was reframe how I view money. I'm excited to act on a lot of the concepts in this book.
