I've been diving into more of the mechanics of FIRE so I'm tearing through a bunch of books on the topic. This book does a great job explaining the path to financial independence through the lens of the authors' personal journey. While I didn't grow up in extreme poverty like the author, I certainly didn't come from wealth either.  Landing in a lucrative career path has always felt a bit weird, so it was great to hear that reflected by the author. While there's a lot of great and practical stuff here, the author often paints with a pretty broad and bold brush that comes across as narrow minded or not fully considered (e.g. "homeownership is stupid; just look at the dollars and cents").
