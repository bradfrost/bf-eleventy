This book came highly recommended by my wife, and I'll say the title is unfortunate because there's great insights in here for all spouses. It's a fantastic book about how to parent as a team, and reinforces communication and collaboration as crucial tools in the parenting toolbox. I'd recommend this book to any new parents.
