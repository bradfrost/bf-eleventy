This was a great book about the importance of changing our mind and constantly reevaluating our stances on consequential issues at both  an individual and a societal level. Cognitive and desirability biases are powerful forces that often lead us to entrenched thinking that limits our ability to grow and take advantage of opportunities. While I thought the content of the book was good, I felt it lacking in certain areas and didn't often care for some of the delivery.
