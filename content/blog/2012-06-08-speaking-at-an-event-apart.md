[![An Event Apart Washington DC 2012](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-08-at-8.44.53-AM-650x397.png)](http://aneventapart.com/2012/dc/) **I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be speaking at[An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/2012/dc/) in Washington DC on August 6th.** My talk, entitled [Beyond Media Queries: An Anatomy of an Adaptive Web Experience](http://aneventapart.com/2012/dc/#day1session5), will dissect my [mobile-first responsive web design demo](http://bradfrost.com/demo/mobile-first/) ([tutorial here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/), [anatomy here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/anatomy-of-a-mobile-first-responsive-web-design/)) to discuss best practices, common pitfalls and emerging responsive patterns. Here's the abstract: 

> Media queries may be responsive design’s secret sauce, but we know there’s a whole lot more that goes into crafting amazing adaptive experiences. By dissecting an example of a mobile-first responsive design, we’ll uncover the principles of adaptive design and highlight some considerations for creating contextually-aware web experiences. We’ll go over emerging mobile web best practices and responsive patterns that can assist in our journey toward a future-friendly web. 

And as fate would have it, I'm sandwiched right in between [Mr Mobile First](http://lukew.com) and [Mr Responsive Web Design](http://ethanmarcotte.com/), which means I can get on stage, say "what these guys say", then walk off the stage. It'll be a short talk. ![Luke Wroblewski, Brad Frost, Ethan Marcotte](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-08-at-8.45.19-AM.png) I'm excited to share the stage with people who have helped me in so many ways throughout my career, and am extremely excited to meet both the speakers and the attendees. I can't wait!
