We’ve been absolutely rocking and rolling over here and are proud to announce that **Chapters 5 and 6 of our[Subatomic Design Tokens Course](https://designtokenscourse.com/) are now live!** With only 2 chapters left to go,**there's only 2 weeks left to[preorder the course at a discounted price](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order).** Chapter 5 covers the nuances of publishing a design token system in Figma and code, and then Chapter 6 goes DEEP into adopting design tokens; we ended up producing 71 videos clocking in at 141 minutes! 🤯 [![Screenshot of Subatomic Design Tokens Course UI](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-07-at-7.37.30 AM-1024x562.png)](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order) Chapter 5 is relatively straightforward and covers the mechanics — and the nuances! — of publishing a token system in design and code. And then in Chapter 6 we cover everything that goes into successfully adopting a design token system. We cover a lot of ground:
 
   * **There is a spectrum of integration for adopting design tokens** : reference only, consuming the token library, and consuming design system components
   * Tokens can be applied to existing components and any new UI work
   * **We put the hard-earned language of our token system to use** , detailing use cases for color and typography conventions like `knockout`, `utility`, `display`, `heading`, and more.
   * We step through how **tokens can power every layer of the design system ecosystem,** including in core design system components, multiple JS frameworks, iOS/Android, recipes, smart components, and individual products
   * **We discuss the**[**power of recipes**](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-art-of-design-system-recipes/), and how they use tokens by both applying components and adopting tokens directly
   * **System makers need to help system users** understand and master this sophisticated, multi-layer ecosystem
 
**In addition to producing 306 videos (and counting!), we also  **[**recently released our battle-tested design tokens architecture for both Figma and code**](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/subatomic-update-figma-and-code-token-architecture-available/)**. It’s all coming together!** [![Animated GIF showing theme Subatomic theme switching in Storybook](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ice-cream-theme-switch-gif.gif)](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order) Only two weeks left to save $150! We’re entering the home stretch with only two chapters left to publish! As mentioned earlier, That means there’s only about two weeks left to preorder the course at a discounted price. By [preordering the course now](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order), you'll get access to:
 
   * Over 7 hours’ worth of in-depth videos
   * A battle-tested design token architecture in Figma and code
   * A private Slack instance with lovely and passionate design tokens enthusiasts
   * First access to the remaining chapters
   * Our eternal love and gratitude
 
The finish line is in sight! We have some amazing momentum going into the home stretch in no small part by all the amazing people who have joined and the feedback we keep getting:

> My expectations for Subatomic were high, and yet they were exceeded. I was hoping to gain knowledge that would help me apply themes to my websites, but Brad and Ian's course helped me understand the fundamentals of design tokens on a remarkably deep level. The way they break down token architecture into practical, implementable systems transformed my approach to design. I now have the confidence to build scalable multi-brand experiences and can tackle any theming challenge that comes my way. I feel I can do anything now 💪.Jeroen van den Hoek

> The course has been a marvelous feast of insights from two of the best and most experienced teachers you could ask for. It came at the perfect time for a project to support customers configuring a white labelled product. The course offers quick and easy to consume videos that in the end are very thorough and cover the whole process end-to-end. Highly recommended! This will be one I come back to again and again.Anthony Quinn
