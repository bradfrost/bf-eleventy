This album is definitely in my top 5 favorite albums of all time, and am also really pumped about the site. It has a kick ass panoramic Street View-esque functionality of the [famous corner](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Rivington+St+%26+Ludlow+St,+New+York,+NY+10002&sll=40.747667,-74.000898&sspn=0.016159,0.037165&g=239+9th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10001&ie=UTF8&z=17&iwloc=addr) of the album cover, and also has a lot of nifty Flash features. Its fun to click around so give it a spin.
