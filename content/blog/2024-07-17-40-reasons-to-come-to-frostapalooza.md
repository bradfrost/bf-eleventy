HOLY SHIT! [Frostapalooza](https://frostapalooza.com/) is happening in exactly one month!  [![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-bg-image-1024x536.png)](https://frostapalooza.com/) I'd really, really, really, truly love for you to come to this **one-of-a-kind, one-night-only concert fandango happening on August 17th in Pittsburgh**. Here's 40 reasons why you should come:
 
   1. You're interested in the answer to the question: **"What happens when you put 40 talented musicians together to operate as a single band?"**
   2. You're also interested in the answer to the question: **"What happens when you give those musicians a whole year to plan a single night of music?"**
   3. All concert proceeds go to two really important causes.
   4. One of the beneficiaries is [**Project Healthy Minds**](https://www.projecthealthyminds.com/), a non-profit doing amazing work to destigmify mental health issues and get people access to mental health care. 
   5. The other beneficiary is [**NextStep Pittsburgh**](https://www.nextstepfitness.org/pittsburgh), a spinal cord rehabilitation center headed up by my cousin Claire. 
   6. The night is **an unabashed celebration of life, community, family, friends, and fun.**
   7. **This is a one-night-only affair and will never happen again**.
   8. The show will be held at the **beautiful Mr Smalls Theatre** , a church-turned-music-venue that has amazing acoustics and has given me so many amazing musical memories. [They Might Be Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MYpOELP_FM) even wrote a song about Mr. Smalls!
   9. I have **600 glow sticks** in my possession and need to use them.
   10. It's been a while since you've had your **face melted by blistering guitar solos**.
   11. Each song will feature a rotating cast of between **7 and close to 20 (!!!) musicians.**
   12. The musicians, my family, and friends have all been busting their asses for close to a year to prepare for this show.
   13. **FULL HORN SECTION** , featuring the incredible talent and raw energy of [**Elby Brass**](https://elbybrass.com/)
   14. Some musicians are current and former music pros who have toured the world, released albums, and done the whole professional music thing. This is the real deal! 
   15. **Many of the musicians are luminaries in the world of design, development, and design systems.** You can get to see them rock the house and rub shoulders with your web heroes.
