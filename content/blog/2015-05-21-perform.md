Make every thing [fight for its life.](https://twitter.com/topdownjimmy/status/598498025892347905)  
Fight for its right to exist.  
Stop adding shit.  
Start killing shit.  
Victory is subtraction.  
Rip it all out.  
Be ruthless.  
Demand better.  
[Reorder](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/weight-wait.html).  
Stop [blindly adopting tools](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/tools_dont_solv.html).  
Stop [breaking the Web](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/media-websites-vs-facebook/).  
Be skeptical.  
Make people give a shit.  
Ram it down their throats.  
Make it [visible](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/581545838712881152).  
Show them.  
[Show the competition eating your lunch](http://www.webpagetest.org/video/).  
[Show them how much it costs](http://whatdoesmysitecost.com/).  
Make them shout with you.  
Don't give up.  
[Beat your head against a wall](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/head-meets-wall/).  
Lather. Rinse. Repeat.  
Make them understand.  
Talk about it differently.  
[Change the culture](http://timkadlec.com/2015/05/choosing-performance/).  
It's a process.  
Don't be discouraged.  
Keep going.  
Get better.  
[Celebrate](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/578295642302316546) the victories.  
Build momentum. [Prioritize performance](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/prioritizing-performance-in-responsive-design/). Treat [performance as design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/performance-as-design/). Good performance is [good design](http://larahogan.me/design/). Good performance is [good development](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/). Good performance is [good business](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/psychology-web-performance/). Good performance is [good for the Web](https://adactio.com/journal/8956). Start caring. Get a machete. Hack away. Death to bullshit. Death to bullshit. [Death to bullshit](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/death-to-bullshit-at-creative-mornings/).
