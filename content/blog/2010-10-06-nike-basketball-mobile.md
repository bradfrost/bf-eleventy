Nike Basketball, along with Converse and the Jordan brand put on the World Basketball Festival, a festival in New York City celebrating all things basketball. Nike Basketball's mobile website was updated to promote the festival, provide event details, highlight the exhibition teams from all over the world, and promote products and nearby retail locations. I was responsible for developing the mobile site and consulting the visual and ID teams to create a fully functional site. Cross-device support was an important priority, so a lot of time was spent making sure the site rendered optimally across a wide range of devices. Technologies Used XHTML, CSS, Javascript, Freemarker
