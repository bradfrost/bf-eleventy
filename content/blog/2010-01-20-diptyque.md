Diptyque is a Paris-based luxury candle company. Pod1 was responsible for developing the ecommerce presence and brand experience pages to sell products online and reinforce their strong brand image.

I was responsible for developing and coordinating the production of the ecommerce site, which included managing the development team, communicating with the client, developing a custom Magento theme and coordinating with the design team to make sure all project goals were met.

The result is a high-impact website that focuses on Diptyque's strong historic brand with an ecommerce section that makes it as easy as possible for users to purchase.
