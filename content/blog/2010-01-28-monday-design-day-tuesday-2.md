[caption id="attachment_542" align="alignnone" width="650" caption="Tuesday #2"][![Tuesday #2](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tuesday-650x650.jpg)](https://bradfrost.com/blog/design/monday-design-day-tuesday-2/attachment/_tuesday-650x650/)[/caption] Just got back yesterday from snowboarding in Stowe, VT. Its been amazing progressing with my wife and it was a ton of fun hanging out with a big house full of people. Because of that the design day got pushed back, so here is the updated version. Now that I (already) broke the pattern, I’m wondering if I should start a new pattern with this. In other words, make next week’s design arrive on Wednesday, then the following Thursday, etc. We’ll see how it goes.
