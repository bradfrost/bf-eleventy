In Is Time Standing Still?, [Oliver Reichenstein](http://informationarchitects.net/) discusses the past's role in today's design. 

  * Used Mad Men Kodak Carousel pitch to explain what advertising is and how to use sentimentality to sell things. 
  * Mad Men promotes a sentimentality about the days of the past. 
  * Nostalgia is a thriving industry: Mad Men, Lana Del Ray, Amy Winehouse, etc 
  * Today's tech mimics the design of the past. For example, [Apple's designs borrow heavily from Braun](http://visual.ly/braun-or-apple "http://visual.ly/braun-or-apple")
  * Analogies from the physical world (especially things like the trash can), when used appropriately, can really enhance a digital user experience. 
  * True innovation is actually just really really small steps. The only people that see the subtle changes are typically other professionals. 
  * **iA Writer innovations** \- can't change type size, focus on one sentence at a time, a typeface that's scales well to many environments. It's hard to sell because it's not necessarily new and shiny. 
  * **It takes time to innovate** , it's hard to follow up on previous success. 
  * There's no such thing as 'big innovation'. It's a series of very very small step. The steam engine and light bulb were all actually incremental changes even though they're regarded as revolutionary. 
  * Skeumorphism is not good design. It's not that sometimes it's sometimes OK, it's always trying to bring the past into the present. 
  * **If you try to imagine the future** , you'll fail. If you try to recreate the past, you'll simply create a simulation. You need to create in the present. It's about finding the balance between borrowing from the past and looking towards the future.
