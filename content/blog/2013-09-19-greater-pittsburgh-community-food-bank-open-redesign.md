I'm excited to announce that [my wife](http://melissafrostdesign.com/) ([@minifrost](https://twitter.com/minifrost)) and I are redesigning the [Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank](http://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/) website. The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB) serves over 400 food pantries in 11 counties, and their mission to feed the hungry is certainly a nobel one. We're proud to help them in their mission by updating their 8 year old website.

We're excited to share what we know, and the organization is excited at the prospect of helping the greater community. Project Timeline We'll be keeping track of the redesign using a project timeline, an idea which I ~~borrowed~~ stole from [Dan Mall](http://danielmall.com/) and [his work](http://rif.superfriend.ly/). The idea of a project timeline is to see a project unfold over time, to make it easy to view progress over time, and to provide a centralized hub for the project resources. You can [view our project timeline](http://foodbank.bradfrost.com/timeline) to see what we've done so far. Here's what it looks like: [![GPCFB Project Timeline](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Google-Chrome1.png)](http://foodbank.bradfrost.com/timeline) I've posted a version of the [project timeline template](https://github.com/bradfrost/project-timeline) on Github, so feel free to use it on your own projects.
