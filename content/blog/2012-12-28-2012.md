2012 has been a whirlwind to say the least, and looking back it's safe to say I kept myself busy. Here's a look at what I was up to in 2012. January
 
   * [A Tel Tale Sign](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/a-tel-tale-sign/) \- a reminder to web designers that mobile phones are indeed _phones_
   * [Test on Real Mobile Devices without Breaking the Bank](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/) \- a look into how to procure testing devices on the cheap
 
February
 
   * Launched [WTF QR Codes](http://wtfqrcodes.com/) with [Craig Villamor](https://twitter.com/cvilly). It turns out we weren't the only one who abhor QR codes, and the site gets [picked](http://www.buzzfeed.com/babymantis/the-best-of-wtf-qr-codes-1opu) [up](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/qr-codes-tumblr-advertising) [by](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/02/wtf-qr) [a](http://gizmodo.com/5890314/wtf-qr-codes-the-definitive-compendium-of-a-sad-and-horrible-technology) [bunch](http://www.delicious.com/redirect?url=http%3A//www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/qr-codes-_n_1322199.html%3Fref%3Dbusiness%23es_share_ended) [of](http://www.businessinsider.com/worst-qr-fails-2012-3?op=1) [different](http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/06/tumblr-tuesday-celebrating-the-wtf-of-qr-codes-and-the-mobile-web/) [publications](http://mashable.com/2012/03/04/funniest-qr-code-fail/).

Here's to 2013! 2012 was an extraordinary year full of lots of changes. 2013 will no doubt be extraordinary as well. I'm making a big career change and [setting out to work for myself](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/onwards/) doing a combination of consulting, front end design, workshops, speaking and writing. I'm sure I'll keep myself busy. Thanks for an amazing year!
