[![Mobilism Conference](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-13-at-3.22.40-PM-650x414.png)](http://mobilism.nl/2012/programme#fast-track-b) I'm thrilled to be speaking at the upcoming [Mobilism](http://mobilism.nl/) conference on May 10th in Amsterdam! I've heard amazing things about the conference and the [speaker list looks absolutely amazing](http://mobilism.nl/2012/programme). I've also never been to Amsterdam before so I'm really excited for the opportunity. To celebrate, I created a new [speaking page](http://bradfrost.com/speaking/) on my site. I'll be presenting a revamped [For a Future-Friendly Web](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/for-a-future-friendly-web/) with a lot of new content and a lot of omissions.    
[View on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/bradfrostweb/for-a-futurefriendly-web) I can't wait. If you're around for the conference, make sure to say hey and I'll buy you a beer. Also, travel tips are very much appreciated!
