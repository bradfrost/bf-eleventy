Like everyone else, the tragic wildfires ravaging Los Angeles area make our hearts ache. We feel for all of our friends, industry pals, and everyone who has been impacted by the fires. LA-based design systems extraordinaire [Elyse Holladay](https://www.elyseholladay.com/) has been displaced because of the fires, and because she's an amazing person she [set up a fund](https://www.designsystemsontheme.com/p/la-fires) to help her feed her displaced community through the World Central Kitchen. If you can, please consider [donating to the cause](https://donate.wck.org/fundraiser/6001981).  [![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fire.png)](https://www.designsystemsontheme.com/p/la-fires) Also, for the next month **we're going to donate $50 of every preorder of[our design tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/) to the fund**. So if you're looking for ways to elevate your design systems game while simultaneously helping feed people in need, consider preordering the course. You can [find more info on the course website](https://designtokenscourse.com/), and you can [watch a video and read more here to get a gist of the +2hrs of content](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-tokens-course-update-2hrs-of-video-now-available/) we've published so far while we develop the full course content:  https://youtu.be/NkihWrBbhGE?si=T_-IDDCYphPZPkZr  I regularly dream that I had a magic wand that could solve the world's problems, but of course that will remain a fantasy. But what I can do is try to help from where I'm at with the tools I have available to me. There are so many issues and causes worthy of our attention, and my hope is to be able to try to help as many as possible. We'll start here for now. Take care and stay safe, everyone.
