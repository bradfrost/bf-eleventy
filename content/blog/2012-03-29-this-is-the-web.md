Since posting [Responsive Web Design: Missing the Point](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-web-design-missing-the-point/) and [For A Future Friendly Web](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/for-a-future-friendly-web/), I've gotten quite a few requests to use a few of my images for presentations and posts. I think these three images succinctly explain why we need to [start thinking in a future-friendly way](http://futurefriend.ly/thinking.html). So here they are in their original format, free for you to use.
