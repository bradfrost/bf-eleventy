Well, here's some great news: Refresh PGH is being...refreshed! My pals [Jason](https://jasonhead.com/), [Val](https://valhead.com/), and [Patrick](https://patrickfulton.net/) are reviving the Pittsburgh web design/development meetup that played such an important role in the development of my career. It's so crucial to rebuild in-person community, so I'm very excited to see more in-person conferences, meetups, and other gatherings. ![Refresh PGH, June 23, 2025, 6-8PM City Kitchen Bakery Square](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3370-1024x1024.png) If you're in Pittsburgh and love the web, design, and development, you should absolutely come! **Details: Monday, June 23rd from 6-8PM at[City Kitchen in Bakery Square](https://www.citykitchenpgh.com/).**
