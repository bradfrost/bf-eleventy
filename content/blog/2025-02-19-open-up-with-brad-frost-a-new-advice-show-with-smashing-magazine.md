I'm thrilled to announce that I'm doing a new advice show/series called [Open Up](https://ti.to/smashingmagazine/open-up-with-brad-1) I'm doing with my good friends at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNnvdH7m6Po  I found that it's often easier for people to talk about tools and technologies and trends than it is to really address the human side of our industry. And frankly, that's where many of our real challenges lie.  For some strange reason I still don't fully understand, people have reached out to me over the years for my advice asking questions like:
 
   * Should I get a new job? 
   * How do I deal with this challenging person at work?
   * I'm struggling with my mental health, what should I do?
   * How should I address my burnout?
   * Is AI going to take my job? 
   * How do I stay focused when the world is on fire?
 
These are types of questions we're doing to dig into on the show!  We want to help you! **Share your situation**  [**in this form**](https://forms.gle/LTMJrXMFHRXXM2CM6) (anonymously and privately if necessary so you can share freely). On the show, we — myself, [Geoff Graham](https://geoffgraham.me/), and likely other guests — will discuss your submission and give actionable advice and guidance and resources and really do what we can to help you get unstuck or to help you move forward in a positive and constructive way. [Join us for our first episode](https://ti.to/smashingmagazine/open-up-with-brad-1) on March 12th, and [consider sharing your questions and struggles](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfn4s1eBakC9cHA1J1zhbDuUPyiuzZT1RE6C--kCQR8IBFlaA/viewform) with us! It's a big part of my mission in life to help people live more fulfilling and creative lives, and would love to help you.
