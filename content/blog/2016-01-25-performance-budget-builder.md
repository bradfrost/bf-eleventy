Performance budgets are awesome. So I [made a thing](http://codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/EPQVBp/) to help you make performance budgets. [![Make A Performance Budget](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Performance-Budget-Builder-1024x816.png)](http://codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/EPQVBp/) The Performance Budget builder lets you lay out your template types, set a size budget for each template type, then plug in the sizes for each asset category that will load in the template. The tool will adjust each category's width accordingly and yell at you if you exceed your budget. Pretty fun! Fair warning, this is mostly an experiment and hasn't been cross-browser tested or anything like that. Feel free to take it and run with it. There's a lot that can be said about performance budgets, but I'll leave that to the pros. Check out these great resources:
