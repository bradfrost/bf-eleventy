   * **3** conference workshops
   * **4** conference talks
   * **1** meetup talk
   * **1** virtual seminar and
   * **3** company workshops in
   * **6** cities in
   * **4** countries
 
And so far this year, I've: 
   * Traveled **97** days (out of 157 days so far) on:
   * **56** airplanes to
   * **27**  cities in
   * **7** countries giving
   * **12**  keynotes and
   * **15** workshops
 
I'm beat. If you need me, I'll be in my back yard with my wife and my dog, trying to remember what it's like to be a normal human being. I'm shoving my devices in the back of a closet for at least a little while. Fingers crossed.
