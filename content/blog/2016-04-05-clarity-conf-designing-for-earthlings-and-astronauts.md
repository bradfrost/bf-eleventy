At [Clarity Conference](http://clarityconf.com/) in San Francisco, [Richard Danne](http://www.dannedesign.com/) discussed his long experience creating style guides for massive organizations. Here are my notes from his talk: 
 
   * Richard didn't invent the style guide, but worked on the [NASA style guide](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thestandardsmanual/reissue-of-the-1975-nasa-graphics-standards-manual), which was one of the first style guides (and was the first for the U.S. government).
   * **The NASA Graphic Standards Manual** began work in 1974 and launched in 1975. It resulted in a great, unified program. Its success was due to it being such a comprehensive document. It wasn't just a logo, but a holistic system.
   * It raises design principles to a new level. It was designed for the ages.
   * Mission: **"we wanted to bring this tech down to earth"**
   * Manual had tabs to flip through to to the different sections:
   * Color - NASA red
   * Logo
   * Business forms - they look so simple, but took over a year to get approval.
   * 4 or 5 different type faces.
   * There was no graphic designer on staff at NASA, so the organization would often take an illustrator and say "Well you know art" and the results were terrible.
   * Had to demonstrate the specifics of how the logo and design should look on ground vehicles, airplanes, and other vehicles.
   * The "flying bathtub shuttles" were all ceramic tiles, so graphic placement was crucial. These shuttles were the first US vehicles to use Helvetica.
   * Required congressional approval and military approval to introduce NASA Red into the color palette.
   * Satellites are still out there with the NASA logo Richard designed.
   * Color had to be flame retardant, which caused a lot of back and forth.
   * Richard was elected as President of AIGA around the time of the NASA manual.
   * When in a crisis, it's sometimes an advantage to make decisions very quickly
   * Did additional work for NASA, including public broadcasting film titles. Contained the first computer animations done in New York City.
   * **"Going to work in space"** posters to be circulated at schools.
   * Space technology led to advancements in medicine, technology, etc.
   * 1983 needed to generate a report to see how successful the design system was.
   * Copy Cat Culture - this stuff seeps into culture and has a life of its own. Lots of knockoffs and inspirations from the NASA logo.
   * Other style guides Richard helped create -Department of Transportation, IBM, Bristol Myers, DuPont, FAA, FIT, Mendez Junior, Pratt and Whitney, Atlantic Mustual Companies, Cape Symphony Orchestra, Kid Knowledge, Napa Valley Jazz Society, AIGAwards
   * **Recently there's been a resurgence of print style guides** , as people can hold them in their hands and tend to respect them more.
   * **The introduction of mobile is forcing us to pull things back and make things simpler, more legible to work on these smaller devices.**
