Its been an interesting couple of weeks. One of the most exciting developments is my invitation to tour with [Midnight Spaghetti](http://www.midnightspaghetti.com/ "Midnight Spaghetti") for a week (June 15th through 22nd) this summer. Midnight Spaghetti and the Chocolate G-Strings is an eclectic funk/hip-hop/jazz band that is loosely based in Harrisonburg, VA and know how to put on a phenomenal live show. I've been in close collaboration with Seth and Mickey of Midnight Spaghetti for the last 4 and a half years, working together on many projects: organizing benefit concerts, recording side projects together, and Seth jumping on stage with [Dangus Kahn](http://www.danguskahn.net "Dangus Kahn and the Tornadoes") to drop some freestyle rhymes. But I've never had a chance to play with them, so I'm excited to finally perform with a band that has made me get up and dance so many times. I want to say it will be a challenge to learn their entire set, but I feel it will be easy. The songs ARE technically difficult, but I've been listening to them since I entered college and my bass style naturally fits in with the funk genre. Plus, I'm just super excited to play with other people again. I'm pumped. Until I post some dates, listen to their long-awaited debut album, [Velour on the Floor](http://midnightspaghetti.com/radio/velouronthefloor/ "Midnight Spaghetti and the Chocolate G-Strings - Velour on the Floor").
