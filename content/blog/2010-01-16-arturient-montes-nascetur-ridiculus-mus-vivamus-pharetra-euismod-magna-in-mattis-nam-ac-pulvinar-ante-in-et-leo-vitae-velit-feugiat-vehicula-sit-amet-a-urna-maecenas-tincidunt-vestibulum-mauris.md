John Varvatos is a world-famous fashion designer known for his rock and roll edge (including buying the old CBGBs). Pod1 was responsible for designing and developing the brand identity pages and blog for the website.

I was responsible for leading a skilled development team that developed full-screen Flash pages, many unique brand pages, a blog and a CMS all powered by Wordpress. In addition, I was responsible for coordinating with other agencies to integrate Pod1's work and create a consistent brand experience across the board.
