Stop calling yourselves "creatives". I [recently read](http://www.blissfulanddomestic.com/2012/03/31-days-to-yumminess-grocery-shopping.html) about a mother who is able to stretch a $14,000 annual income to feed and clothe her family. _That_ , ladies and gentlemen, is creative. Your fucking banner ad campaign is not. Every person on earth has a tremendous [capacity for creativity](http://sirkenrobinson.com/?page_id=15). The world needs more people to feel empowered to have original thoughts and put them out into the world. Using "creative" as a noun to describe a class of people perpetuates the false notion that some people have it and others don't. It's condescending and discouraging. Now, I understand some people make their living by flexing their creative muscles, and I think that's amazing. But please don't call yourselves "creatives". What should you call yourself instead? I don't know, but I'm sure you'll figure something out. After all, you're creative.
