I'm messing with my MailChimp account and really love their [Brand Kit](https://mailchimp.com/help/use-brand-kit-creative-assistant/) feature. You have the ability to upload logos, define color palettes, typography, personality, button styles, and more.  ![Screenshot of MailChimp's Brand Kit experience, showing a menu to customize logo, fonts, colors, brand personality, and button styles](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-10.32.28 AM-1024x516.png) I especially like the experience around managing logos. They provide a number of scenarios where you see your logo sitting against certain background colors. "Can this logo be applied on white or light backgrounds" with a simple toggle switch for each scenario. I really love this! It's a really elegant way to navigate a common, thorny problem.  ![Screenshot showing MailChimp's Brand Kit logo editor, where the logo is placed against brand colors and images and gives the user the ability to select whether or not it is legible & accessible.](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mailchimp-logo-usage-691x1024.png) Can things still slip between the cracks? Sure! But these types of system-level things make it easier for people to automatically do the right things. **Make the best thing the easy thing.** Perhaps I'm primed to notice these things because in [our design tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/) we're digging into all of the accessibility considerations and gory details of managing content sitting on a specific background. This is just some of the incredibly useful and inspirational stuff we're weaving into the course content. Great job, MailChimp team!
