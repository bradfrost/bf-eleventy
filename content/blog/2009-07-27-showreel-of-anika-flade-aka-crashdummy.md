Its been a while since I've posted anything because (in the words of my boss) I'm busier than God, so I figure I will post up the 2008 showreel of Anika Flade, an amazingly talented motion designer I have the extreme good fortune to work with.  [SHOWREEL 2008](http://vimeo.com/979415) from [crashdummy.net](http://vimeo.com/user304157) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com). View more of Anika's work at [crashdummy.net](http://www.crashdummy.net/portfolio.php "Crashdummy.net") and especially check out her brilliant short film, [Love Me](http://www.crashdummy.net/loveme/ "Love Me, by Anika Flade"). It is currently making the film festival rounds and has gotten a wonderful response.
