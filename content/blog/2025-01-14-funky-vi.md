https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nrbRFs6G-k  I just got a [Squire Bass VI](https://www.fender.com/en-US/squier-electric-basses/other/classic-vibe-bass-vi/0374580500.html), an instrument I didn't know existed until developer/musician [Tim Hilton](https://timhilton.dev/) mentioned it to me in a LinkedIn message (of all places!). I had a few holiday/birthday gift cards to [my favorite local music store](https://nstuffmusic.com/) burning a hole in my pocket, so I decided to go for it. And holy smokes, what a fun instrument!  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RtrOTmts640  It's wild I didn't know about this instrument before considering I own a 6-string bass and played it through college: ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20-700x934.png) The Bass VI feels completely different than a 6-string bass, and sounds different too! I can tell I'm going to have a lot of fun with this. Video skillz I'm now [making design system courses](https://designtokenscourse.com/) and have a few other projects that I'm excited to announce soon. All of these things require me to level up my video editor skills, which I've long wanted to do. I've been using relatively basic video editing software for a long time, but I feel like I should learn more pro software like Final Cut Pro and Premiere.  I honestly don't know if this instinct is correct or if I should carry on with software I'm more proficient with (freaking love [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) and now [Descript](https://descript.com)), but here I am googling how to do really basic stuff in Final Cut Pro. I was thankfully able to cobble together me playing a few different instruments, and hope to do a lot more of that!  Anyways, more music, video, and fun in 2025!
