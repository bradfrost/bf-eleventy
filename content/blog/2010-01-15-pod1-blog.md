Pod1's own blog contains a wealth of information about current web trends, SEO, design-related news and much more.

I was responsible for the front-end development of the blog. I focused on readability, light page load and integrating Pod1's other networks (Twitter and Flickr) into the mix.

The result is a fun-themed legible blog that contains a ton of valuable industry news and advice.
