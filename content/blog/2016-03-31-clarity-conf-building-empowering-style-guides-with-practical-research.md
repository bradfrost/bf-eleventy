At [Clarity Conference](http://clarityconf.com/), a conference all about design systems and style guides (!) in San Francisco, [Isaak Hayes](http://ihcreative.com/) & [Donna Chan](http://www.heyoitsdonna.com/) describe their process for creating a style guide at [AppDirect](http://www.appdirect.com/). Here are my notes: 
 
   * Style guides should be usable for users and have an positive impact on the organization.
   * At AppDirect they made a style guide but found that it wasn't addressing user needs. They built components in isolation and had a hard time getting it adopted.
   * So they talked to other companies. Other organization made things in silos, leading to a misalignment of needs. Things were either too technical or led to different directions. As a result these things were thrown in the trash. People saw it as a big waste of time and effort, which led to a negative perception of style guides. That made it harder to try again.
   * They went about fixing this by establishing a style guide research process: **Discover, Interview, Understand, Define**
   * **Discover** \- Who are the people we need to talk to? Style guide means different things to different people. Cast a wide net to capture everyone who will be affected by the style guide.
   * Different kinds of people to interview: **Users, builders, and stakeholders**.
   * **Style Guide Users** \- designers, developers product managers, QAs, Sales, Marketing, docs, people who will be making use of the style guide
   * **Builders** \- Designers, frontend, engineers, PMs, docs, people who will actually be creating the style guide
   * **Stakeholders** \- CEO, Department heads, project leads, people who will be influenced by the creation of the style guide.
   * There may be overlap in the different user groups
   * What current projects will be affected by the style guide? Talk with those people who work on current and future projects
   * **Consider product-specific needs** \- not a blanket system across the board. Perhaps your organization has a themeable UI
   * **Interview** \- What problems are we trying to solve with the style guide?
   * **Interviewing users** \- What are your pain points? Uncover goals - What would a style guide enable you to achieve? Usability - what info do you need from a style guide?
   * **Interviewing builders** \- Also may be users, so ask them same questions. What goals do they have? What makes a successful style guide? Uncover requirements
   * **Interviewing stakeholders** \- Uncover the problems they hope to solve. What goals do they have?
   * Interviewing tips: have face-to-face interviews, pull out nuggets, use sticky notes, and if you have to divide and conquer to complete interviews
   * Understand - how do you make sense of all the interviews and info? Find common trends across interviewees and make problem statements
   * **Define** \- how to take those problem statements and do something with them? Defined principles, user stories, and metrics
   * **Principles** \- Take problem statement and convert to key principle ("redline designs take forever!" translates to _efficiency_ as a key principle). Whatever principles you establish should get your team aligned to do good work together.
   * Create user stories - Take a principle and convert it into an actual use case (For efficiency as a principle: "As a designer, I need to communicate basic elements of a page to an engineer")
   * **Define Metrics** \- What are the effects of a principle like efficiency? Maybe a decrease in JIRA tickets? Shorter code review? Fewer Github changes? Faster production?
   * Maybe send out surveys if concrete metrics are hard to come by. How are people feeling before and after?
   * **Problems** \- discover pain points
   * **Principles** \- help guide the process
   * **User Stories** \- know exactly what we're building and for whom
   * **Metrics** \- measure the impact of the style guide
