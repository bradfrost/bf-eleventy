**Note: we've lined someone up, which means submissions for the apprenticeship are now closed. But please keep your eyes peeled for future opportunities.** ![We're hiring an apprentice with an image of apartment buildings in the background](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/apprentice.png) Ian and I have a ton of fun projects brewing, so **we’re looking for a creative, passionate, curious, and kind go-getter to help us make it all happen**. If you're a looking for an opportunity to get your hands dirty and gain some real-world experience doing a bunch of cool things, this position is for you. What’s the gig? We’ve got a ton of irons in the fire, so the work will be wide ranging. Here’s some of the things you’d be getting into:
 
   * Web design
   * Front-end development
   * Video editing
   * Podcast editing
   * Audio editing
   * Email newsletter stuff
   * Graphic design
   * Copy editing
   * Social media stuff
   * Research
   * Customer service & admin assistance
   * Making things happen!
 
WHEW that’s a lot of stuff, which is why we need help! It's important to note that this isn’t a specialized role where we’re only looking for help in one area; the gig involves working on a variety of things. You’d be working directly with me and Ian, and we’ll provide plenty of support, education, feedback, and career coaching along the way. Who are we looking for?
 
   * Above all, we’re looking for a Good Human Being to work with. We work exclusively with honest, kind, curious, and creative people.
   * Someone with an enthusiasm for design, technology, creativity, and the web
   * Somebody somewhere in the world. This is a remote position, and we’re used to working with people across time zones. That said, expect to have some face time with us during our 10AM-6PM EST working hours.
   * A relatively junior person. We expect some familiarity with some things, but we're not looking for people with 15 years of experience here. 
   * Someone with a can-do attitude who can quickly familiarize themselves with new things, take some loose direction, and run with it
   * A jack-of-all-trades person who's looking for wide-ranging experience in the world of digital stuff
   * Someone who enjoys creative work as well as more production-focused, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-do-it work.
 
Details The apprenticeship is 12 weeks long and you'd be providing 20 hours of work per week. You'd be paid $50/hr. How to apply The only real prerequisite for applying is that **you must have a personal website**. It doesn’t have to be amazing, robust, or current; it just needs to exist. **_Don't_ attach your resumé, and we _don’t_ want to hear about your professional skills or experience. **Instead, we want to hear about you! What has you waking up excited? What are your hobbies? What's your philosophy of life? What music do you enjoy? Family? Friends? Pets? What makes you _you_? To apply, email [hello@bradfrost.com](mailto:hello@bradfrost.com). We're looking to hire someone right away, and we're going to do our best to get back to people as soon as possible. **Absolutely no recruiters, agencies, or robots.** **Again, we've lined someone up already, so be on the lookout for future opportunities.**
