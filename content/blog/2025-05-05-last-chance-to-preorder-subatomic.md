[![Anxiety-inducing countdown clock for 36 hours](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-05-2025-12-30-45.gif)](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order) We wanted to launch last week, but Mother Nature had other plans. Our area got hit by a huge storm that knocked out power for 500,000 people. Even though Ian and I live 5 minutes from each other, we ended up with some serious obstacles in our way! ![A downed telephone pole dangerously hanging over a road](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1bdb2aba-4252-4149-83e5-4b8675251cea-edited.jpeg) Power is back! Which means we're back! We recorded, edited, & published the remaining videos and designed the course completion certificate to share on LinkedIn, your resumé, social media, and to hang on your refrigerator!
