There's been a whirlwind of activity lately and there's some exciting events right around the corner. After speaking about the mobile web at R/GA for over a year, it's time to take the show on the road! Breaking Development Conference ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bdonf.jpg) First up is a trip down to Nashville TN for [Breaking Development Conference](http://www.bdconf.com/). I'm absolutely thrilled and humbled to have the opportunity to share the stage with [such amazing speakers](http://www.bdconf.com/speakers), many of whom I've been following my entire career. So yeah, I'm pretty pumped. [Jack Bishop](http://interwebjack.com/) and I will be presenting [Selling the Mobile Web](http://www.bdconf.com/topics#brad_frost), where we'll talk about the importance of convincing clients, bosses and colleagues to prioritize the mobile web and to come together as a community to move this marvelous medium forward. I can't wait to finally meet a lot of people that I've talked with online and am very much looking forward to having some great conversations. CapitolJS ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-06-at-1.30.36-AM.jpg) I'll be flying up from Nashville to Washington D.C. on September 18th to speak at [CapitolJS](http://capitoljs.com). Jack and I will be on Track B discussing Progressive Enhancement for the Mobile Web. I'm excited to learn from a bunch of [the Javascript masters](http://capitoljs.com/speakers.html) that will be speaking there and to see what crazy stuff everyone's working on now. Pittsburgh Web Design Day ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-06-at-1.30.47-AM.png) I'm really pumped to go back to my home city of Pittsburgh for the 3rd annual [Web Design Day](http://webdesignday.com), put on by the venerable Jason and Val Head. I'll be presenting [Unraveling the Mobile Web](http://webdesignday.com/speakers.html), which will discuss the twists and turns of the mobile web and how designers can approach it. I'm looking forward to reconnecting with the Pittsburgh web design community and seeing what they're up to! Forward, March! Many people would rather die than to public speak. I am not one of those people. I absolutely love sharing knowledge and very much want to spread the gospel of the mobile web. So if you know of any speaking opportunities, please let me know and I'd be more than happy to contribute. Here's to safe travels for all!
