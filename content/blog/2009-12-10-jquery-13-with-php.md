[![jQuery 1.3 with PHP](https://www.packtpub.com/images/full/1847196985.jpg)](http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-1-3-with-php "jQuery 1.3 with PHP") I'm super excited to have just received [jQuery 1.3 with PHP](http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-1-3-with-php "jQuery 1.3 with PHP") from Packt Publishing to review. I've only just begun the read but I can already tell its going to be an extremely powerful resource to refer to. It is written for PHP developers who are looking for ways to optimize their web applications, reduce strain on servers and create sexy user interfaces that work hand in hand with the power of PHP. Its chock full of AJAX and other delicious bits and thoroughly explains whats happening on the front-end as well as the back-end. I will post the full review when I've finished the book, so in the meantime, you should [buy the book here](http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-1-3-with-php "jQuery 1.3 with PHP") or read my review of another Packt book, [Magento Beginner's Guide](https://bradfrost.com/blog/web/magento-beginners-guide-review-part-1/ "Magento Beginner's Guide").
