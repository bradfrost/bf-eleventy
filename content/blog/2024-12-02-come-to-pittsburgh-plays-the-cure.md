FRIENDS! FAMILY! COUNTRYMEN! **On Saturday, December 14th** I'll be performing as part of [Pittsburgh Plays The Cure](https://www.pittsburghplays.com/) at the beautiful [Roxian Theatre](https://www.roxiantheatre.com/). Several super groups comprised of Pittsburgh-based musicians will be playing a whole night of music by [The Cure](https://www.thecure.com/).  [![Promo image for Pittsburgh Plays The Cure featuring a picture of me sticking my tongue out while playing bass. Concert info is featured: Sat December 14th at The Roxian Theater, 8PM.](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Brad-Frost-1x1-1-1024x1024.png)](https://concerts.livenation.com/pittsburgh-plays-the-cure-mc-kees-rocks-pennsylvania-12-14-2024/event/16006109C1C32B63) I didn't know enough about The Cure before signing onto this show. (I know, I know. But they were before my time and in the weird gap between my parent's music and the music I claimed as my own.) Holy shit do they have some phenomenal music. Seriously check out their new album, Songs Of A Lost World.  Our group has been regularly practicing and oh boy WE SOUND REALLY REALLY GOOD if you don't mind me bragging a bit. I'm super pumped to be playing some pretty incredible and iconic bass lines as part of the show. So yeah, you should come! And guess what? **I can get you 50% off the ticket price!** Here's how: 1\. Go to [the tickets page right here](https://concerts.livenation.com/pittsburgh-plays-the-cure-mc-kees-rocks-pennsylvania-12-14-2024/event/16006109C1C32B63).  
2\. Choose **General Admission Floor** tickets and click the **Unlock** option.  
3\. **Enter the code "LULLABY"** to unlock the 50% discounted price. So yeah, that's it! This is seriously going to be a ton of fun, and if for anything else you'll see me trying my best to look the part of a broody goth guy. Which is pretty hilarious! But seriously it's going to be a great night of music, and if you're able to make it I'd love to see you there!
