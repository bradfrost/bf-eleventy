I'm extremely excited to be a part of [Smashing Conf NYC](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2024) coming up on October 7-10. I'll be:
 
   * Delivering a full-day (and apparently sold-out!) workshop about [creating and maintaining successful design systems](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/the-already-here-future-of-prototyping.html) on October 7th.
   * [Kicking off the conference](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2024/schedule#day2) on October 8th with my deliberately-clickbaity title "Is Atomic Design Dead?" where I'll be talking about the past, present, and future of design systems. 
   * [Hosting a music jam session after the conference](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2024/brads-jam) on October 9th! Because the Smashing crew is so amazing, they've lined up an amazing rehearsal space kitted out with instruments for interested attendees to join and play. What to expect? When we first did this in Antwerp, we ended up having an absolute blast blending everyone's talents and instincts together. I'm VERY excited for this!
