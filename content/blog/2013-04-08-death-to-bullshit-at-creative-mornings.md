It was an extreme honor to be invited to speak at [Creative Mornings](http://www.creativemornings.com/) in Pittsburgh. I love the lecture series and it was an honor to speak in my hometown about one of my favorite topics: the future. I had an absolute blast speaking at Creative Mornings, and hope you enjoy the video. More bullshit to come...
