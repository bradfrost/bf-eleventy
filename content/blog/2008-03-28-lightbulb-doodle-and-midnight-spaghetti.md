[![brad frost's lightning doodle](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2219/2367429187_208e349aa7.jpg?v=0)](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2219/2367429187_208e349aa7.jpg?v=0 "Brad Frost's Lightning Doodle on Flickr") Cleaning my room tonight I found the original scrap of paper that inspired me to make a painting out of the doodle. It was a simple drawing that was done in a meeting at work, and as I looked at it more, I saw the possibility of a cool painting. So a 3' x 4' canvas is in my room right now with this swirling lightbulb glaring at me and begging me to finish it. I've been so incredibly busy lately...I feel like I'm living 8 lives at once. So finding this little doodle tonight really put things into perspective, that big things can be created from a mindless sketch, that great things can come accomplished with a simple optomistic mentality. In other news, I will be on tour with [Midnight Spaghetti](http://midnightspaghetti.com "Midnight Spaghetti's Website") next weekend in Burlington, VT (I've never been there) and Albany, NY (never been there either)! I'm quite excited to get back up on stage and lay down some funk, especially with such a great band that's known for their energetic performances. I'll fit right in.
