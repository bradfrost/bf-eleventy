[Mat Marquis](https://twitter.com/wilto) explains the current status of element queries, which have now been rebranded as "container queries". This is a big and necessary step for pattern-based design and development. We all just want to create components, drop them into any layout, and have them Just Work. Mat explains how element queries caused circular logic, and how container queries could show a better way forward. If you're interested in helping the cause, Mat shares how you can help: 

> Clone [the repo](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/cq-demos), copy the `demo-template` directory into `/demos`, give your demo a name, and build something using container queries. Be sure to [let us know how it goes](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/cq-demos/issues), whether good or bad.
 
 For more information on element/container queries, I've [rounded up a bunch of resources](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#element-queries) on the topic at This Is Responsive.
