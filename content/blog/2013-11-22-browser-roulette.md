So I had a thought: 

> Idea: browser roulette. During dev, every time you refresh you get a random browser's rendering of the page.-- Brad Frost (@brad_frost) [November 22, 2013](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/statuses/404012021554757633)
 
 Basically, I want to be given a random browser's rendering of my page every time I refresh the page. Why? As time goes on, we have to be considerate of more browsers, devices, screen sizes, environments, settings, and a whole slew of other variables. I've found that having quick access to tools that let me [test all different screen sizes](http://bradfrost.com/demo/ish/) and even [test on real devices during development](https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/mobile-workflow) make me a more considerate developer. I learn about potential gotchas and downfalls before I go down crazy rabbit holes. I hate cross-browser testing as much as the next developer, and a lot of it is due to the fact that cross-browser testing typically happens after I've spent a lot of time getting things to work in my browser of choice. The same way that [ish.](http://bradfrost.com/demo/ish/) and [remote preview](http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/) make it easy for me to be more considerate of different screen sizes and devices, I'd like a tool that lets me be more considerate of more browsers. What do you think? Is this possible? Crazy? Stupid? [CrazySexyCool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrazySexyCool)?
