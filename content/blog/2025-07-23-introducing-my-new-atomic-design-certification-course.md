[![Atomic Design Certification Course by Brad Frost - $50 preorder sale price](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/atomic-design-sale-2-1024x576.png)](https://atomicdesigncourse.com/) **TL;DR:** You can preorder my new [Atomic Design Certification Course](https://atomicdesigncourse.com/) for only $50! Why create an Atomic Design Certification Course? I've got big ambitious for this course, and I'm aiming to:
 
   * **Help organizations increase design system adoption** and create higher-quality, more connected digital products
   * **Help every discipline understand design system foundations, best practices, and pitfalls to avoid**.
   * **Help people land jobs, get promoted, and achieve success**
   * **Write a second edition of my _Atomic Design_ book**, which will integrate over a decade's worth of experience helping countless organizations implement Atomic Design to create and evolve design systems
 
Increase design system adoption For years, people (me included!) were shouting for design systems to be taken seriously, with real people, time, resources, and money dedicated to them. And for the most part, that came to fruition!  However, we became victims of our own success. When design systems became "A Thing", in many ways they became "A Separate Thing". This split has created distance between design systems and the products they serve.  ![Illustration of ](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-2.49.03-PM-1-1024x569.jpg) Since the [very beginning](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), Atomic Design has helped people understand that user interfaces are interconnected, hierarchical systems. **My course will describe how Atomic Design creates a virtuous circle between design systems and the products they serve.** And not just in theory; the course will demonstrate how to practically and pragmatically implement Atomic Design in your everyday product design & development workflow. ![An illustration showing ](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-2.51.48-PM-1-1024x575.jpg) Shared understanding and alignment ****Design systems are critical infrastructure for creating successful digital products** , and therefore need to be understood by everyone involved in product success.** Unfortunately, there is still so much confusion and misunderstanding about design systems. "Design systems" is such an unfortunate name, and that goddamn name continues to cause _so much_ confusion across (even mature!) digital organizations. That's why **this course will be accessible and relevant to _all_ **experience leve** ls and disciplines: developers, designers, product owners, managers, QA, and really anyone responsible for making and maintaining successful digital products.** Design systems veterans know that the key to real success is in creating shared language, understanding, and alignment.  Help people land jobs, get promoted, achieve success For reasons I still can't quite comprehend, [_Atomic Design_](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) has been woven into the lexicon of design systems. It shows up in job postings, bizarre executive presentations, and the everyday language of digital teams around the world.  Perhaps that’s why people have asked me for years,  _“Is there a way to get certified in Atomic Design?”_ I used to think that was weird because my mind always went straight to sterile & soulless business certifications. But now I realize the real utility in an Atomic Design certification! A proper certification course can help move beyond bullshitty buzzwords and help people demonstrate that they know design system foundations, processes, and best practices.  _Atomic Design_ , 2nd Edition! Developing this course is the first step in bringing the 2nd edition of my [_Atomic Design_ book](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) to life! I've spent the last decade living the principles and processes I describe in the book, and I've been wanting to bring all of my hard-earned, real-world lessons and insights back into it. This course is an important stepping stone for the next book edition, and they will exist as close companions. I'm stoked! What's in the online course? **The course will be a self-paced online video course** , consisting of 5 chapters packed with fundamentals, best practices, real-world advice, and tons of resources. It will help you and your team:
 
   * **Better understand the core concepts, benefits, and ROI of design systems**
   * **Master the Atomic Design methodology** to actually connect your design system to real-world products.
   * **Increase design system adoption** by demonstrating how to tactically implement Atomic Design into your product workflow
   * **Avoid common pitfalls and embrace best practices** to ensure your design system becomes more valuable over time rather than dying on the vine
 
By completing the course, you can**flex your design system mastery with a fancy certificate of completion** that you can share on your resumé, LinkedIn, and your fridge.
