[![Breaking Development Conference Dallas 2012](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-23-at-2.45.53-PM-650x565.png)](http://bdconf.com/2012/dallas) I'm absolutely thrilled to be speaking at [Breaking Development Conference](http://bdconf.com/2012/dallas) in Dallas September 24-26. I've learned SO MUCH at the past bdconf events so I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to contribute!  I'll also be attending the upcoming [Breaking Conference in Orlando](http://bdconf.com/2012/orlando) on April 16-18 as a sponsor for [R/GA](http://rga.com). We're currently hiring a shit ton of people so if you're interested in doing awesome mobile & responsive projects for some of the biggest brands in the world, let me know or check the [job openings](http://www.rga.com/careers/apply/job-openings). We can talk in Orlando as there is still a few tickets available, so it's not too late to hop on board. I'm also [speaking at Mobilism](http://bradfrost.com/blog/notes/speaking-at-mobilism/) in Amsterdam coming up in May so hopefully I will see you there or at Breaking Deveopment. I absolutely love this shit and can talk all day about it, so if you're interested in having me [speak](http://bradfrost.com/speaking/) at your event, feel free to [contact me](http://bradfrost.com/contact/).
