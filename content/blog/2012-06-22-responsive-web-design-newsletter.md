I've been getting this responsive design question on an increasingly-frequent basis: **"Where do I go to learn about all this stuff?"** I spend a lot of my time sharing responsive design resources on Twitter, but am finding that 140 characters isn't enough space to properly articulate everything's that's going on. To remedy this, I'm working on a lot of things right now that can hopefully help keep people up to speed with this crazy fast-moving stuff. The first of these efforts is a [responsive web design newsletter](http://bradfrost.com/responsive-web-design-newsletter/). [Check out the first issue](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6c0c3f4dcd40d88bc1cedb3fa&id=261e7d6a4d&e=99c8c8bb6d) and feel free to [sign up](http://bradfrost.com/responsive-web-design-newsletter/). Somewhere along the line I found that talking about and sharing all this stuff has become just as fun as making it. If you have any resources you'd like to be considered for the newsletter, hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/brad_frost). Enjoy!
