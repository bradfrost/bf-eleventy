I'm so freaking excited to announce my new music project: [Cold Album Drumming](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/)!  https://youtu.be/uXA3yj_bK8k?si=fPrOWOJGZCU_cIhe  Be sure to smash that subscribe button [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ColdAlbumDrumming) 😂 and [vote on the albums](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/) you'd like to hear me play. What the heck is "Cold Album Crumming?" **Cold Album Drumming is where I play along to the albums I know intimately, but have never played drums to before. The drums are recorded totally cold: One take. Cover-to-cover. No learning. No listening. No practice. No warm-up. In most cases, I haven't listened to the album in many years.** I give a little preamble to describe my relationship with the album, then I hit record and let 'er rip. Why do this? **Quite simply, it's fun. Fun to operate on pure recall, fun to figure things out on the fly, fun to play along with some of my favorite music, fun to have a musical outlet I can squeeze into my lunch break.** 200 albums I've been chipping away at Cold Album Drumming for months now. Whenever I find a spare window of time before work, during my lunch, or after work I'll scramble down to my basement, quickly pick an album to play, hit record, and go at it.  So far, I've identified about 200 albums that I feel I could play, and keep thinking of more to add. These albums have been the soundtrack to my life, so I know the songs, the parts, and the music pretty dang well. But with a few exceptions I've never played drums to them before. It's a really fun project to connect with some of my favorite music in a totally different way. I always come away with a greater appreciation of the album and the artists that created them. Launching with 8 albums So far I've recorded 25 albums that I'll be trickling out on a steady weekly rhythm (you should [subscribe on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ColdAlbumDrumming) and [RSS](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/feed.xml)). I'm [launching the website with 8 albums](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/#played)! I picked some really fun ones to start. I'll link them up as well as a sample song from each album:  [Discovery by Daft Punk](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/discovery/) https://youtu.be/FEZ8y0kuJhg?si=jthJOEhDFcd2TyN3  [Watch the whole album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/discovery/) [In Rainbows by Radiohead](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/in-rainbows/) https://youtu.be/TOsEv82OP1U?si=aqgwU0kcpaTCmR1T  [Watch the whole album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/in-rainbows/) [Santogold by Santigold](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/santogold/) https://youtu.be/GCxb9Q2xBo8?si=6lFNJlbs-4GLe5q_  [Watch the whole album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/santogold/) [Aquemini by Outkast](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/aquemini/) https://youtu.be/-2yYUdVMHOM?si=YkN9NLJKcmoLHtTa  [Watch the whole album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/aquemini/) [Emperor Tomato Ketchup by Stereolab](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/emperor-tomato-ketchup/) https://youtu.be/cz-Fl5V3Y5I?si=igYS0hEx9w8yatlk  [Watch the full album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/emperor-tomato-ketchup/) [Plastic Beach by Gorillaz](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/plastic-beach/) https://youtu.be/KwOfGghk9c0?si=5ob1nBZc0v8nlWl6  [Watch the full album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/plastic-beach/) [Lola vs Powerman and the Moneygoround by The Kinks](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/lola-vs-powerman/) https://youtu.be/yMATUf5borE?si=KPV-99h3XTGqvFn2  [Watch the full album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/lola-vs-powerman/) [The Crane Wife by The Decemberists](https://youtu.be/rNBiCmZGMj4?si=nlQaTkNPv3cZ8PL2) https://youtu.be/rNBiCmZGMj4?si=nlQaTkNPv3cZ8PL2  [Watch the full album](https://coldalbumdrumming.com/the-crane-wife/) Vote!
