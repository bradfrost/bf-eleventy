[![For a Future-Friendly Web on A List Apart](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-12-at-6.18.42-PM-650x487.png)](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/for-a-future-friendly-web) I had the extreme privilege of writing [an article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/for-a-future-friendly-web) for A List Apart, an invaluable resource I've been learning from since day one of my career. Now it's one thing to get a chance to contribute to something that's given me so much, but it's something else entirely to be featured next to the great [Stephanie Rieger](http://twitter.com/stephanierieger). I've been heavily influenced by [Yiibu](http://yiibu.com/)'s work and I've learned so much from her and Bryan, so it's an absolute honor. Her piece is called [The Best Browser is the One You Have with You](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-best-browser-is-the-one-you-have-with-you/) and is an absolute must-read. Resources There's **a lot** of resources in my article, so I've gathered them all here in one place:

Over 40 links? Damn. Thank you thank you thank you I know this is just an article, but--shit man--I spent **a lot** of time on it. Because of that I want to thank some people that really helped me out.

  * All of the Future Friendly collaborators for crafting these thoughts--Jason Grigsby, Lyza Danger Gardner, Luke Wroblewski, Josh Clark, Scott Jehl, Jeremy Keith, Scott Jenson, Bryan Rieger, Stephanie Rieger. 
  * The wonderful ALA people, especially Krista Stevens who very nicely pushed me to stop sucking at writing, and Jeffery Zeldman who gave me the opportunity to write for ALA.
  * Awesome people--Jack Bishop, Dave Olsen, Aaron Gustafson, Mike Gallay, Ethan Marcotte, James Pearce, Brian Fling, Matt Marquis, Tim Kadlec, Jason Head, Val Head, Paul Irish and plenty more
  * Twitter - Everyone who I go back and forth with on a regular basis. People who share links, call bullshit and enjoy the ongoing conversation as much as I do.
  * My wife, who puts up with all this crazy shit. I love her to death.

This was a big challenge for me and I'm happy I saw it through. Now on to the next challenges!
