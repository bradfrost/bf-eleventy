In his talk [Where There's Muck, There's Brass](http://smashingconf.com/conference/day:monday#mark-boulton), Mark Boulton asks how digital products age over time and urges us to build more sustainable designs.

  * Different taps - let a tap be a tap - why do people try to arbitrarily reinvent a simple two-knob process for the sake of design? 
  * Designers are assholes sometimes. They try to reinvent the wheel 
  * Design is honesty. Truth. Not bullshitting users. 
  * Skeumorphism festering everywhere like a virus. Let it be what it is. Don't make it wood, it's not a bookcase! A common argument in defense of skeumorphism is "well, old people." You don't automatically drop a bunch of IQ points as soon as you hit a certain age. 
  * **Trends are bullshit.** If you want to be in a trendy industry, go work in fashion, not web design. 
  * **Are you building something of worth?** And are you building something sustainable? 
  * Reductionist process. The simpler you get, the more obvious the cracks get. 
  * How do physical objects age? 

Patina

  * Seasoning a wok seals in the flavor. Over time seasoning builds up and gives flavor to the food. This is known as "breath of wok". 
  * Jeans patina - don't wash new jeans for 6 months and they wear in a more natural way. 
  * Films that have gotten better over time. Jaws: because of the technical shark malfunctions, they resorted to using sound therefore creating a far more suspenseful movie. Alien is another movie that uses music, tension and silence to create a more authentic experience that has gotten better over time. 
  * How do digital products age? **Pixels are cheap.**

Happy Accidents

  * Designing web sites is a fucking messy business. 
  * "Bob Ross is the reason I'm a designer." It's all about happy accidents. 
  * "Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face." Mike Tyson 
  * The design process is weird and complicated because it involves people, who are weird and complicated. 

Being Adaptable 

  * **Sketch sketch sketch** \- quickly iterate in a very efficient. 
  * Use what tools give you the least headwind. 
  * What are the materials of the web? What is your content _made of_? 
  * Certain typefaces are designed with the quality of the material they're going to be printed on. 

Sustainable design

  * How can we create digital experiences that stand the test of time? 
  * Incremental improvements create more sustainable design 
  * **1% Improvements** \- Improve, iterate, change quickly. 
  * We like to think the web is like our dog. Sit. Roll Over. We just give it commands. It's more subtle, like a cat. 
  * Let's be **authentically digital**. The authenticity doesn't come from the UI, it comes from the stuff the web is made of.
