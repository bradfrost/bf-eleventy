As I've previously displayed before ([here ](https://bradfrost.com/blog/empire-state-building-full-moon "Empire State Building Full Moon")and [here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/foggy-empire-state-building "Foggy Empire State Building")), I've got a pretty good view of the Empire State Building from right outside my apartment. Well my buddy Matt came up last weekend for his first dose of New York City and so we hit all the hot spots. That's right, we went straight to the top of the Empire State Building. And wouldn't you know it? I can see my place from there! It didn't really occur to me that because I have a direct line of sight of the building from the ground that I would also have a straight shot of my place from the top of the Empire State Building. So here's my place: [![My Apartment](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/matt-visit-035.jpg)](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/matt-visit-035.jpg) Mine's that gray building to the right of the two connected red brick buildings. I know its not much, but it excited me!
