"Follow your energy" is advice that I give freely and strive to follow in my own life.  Listen closely to your energy; it often tells you where you need to go. It may take you to the studio, to your people, to your computer, to the gym, to the kitchen, to bed, or somewhere entirely new.  ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/follow-your-energy-1024x183.png)
