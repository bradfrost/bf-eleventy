"Do you envy me?" asks the startup fashion and music company Enve Me. Pod1 created a website for the fashion/music/lifestyle brand that included an ecommerce site, blog and more.

I was responsible for leading the development team in the production of the site, which featured downloadable MP3 products, video detail pages, an integrated blog and streaming sitewide MP3 player.

The result was a cohesive and immersive experience into the brand, which wanted you to envy them and their fashion prowess.
