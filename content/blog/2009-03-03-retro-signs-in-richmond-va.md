He lives in a cozy little part of town right off a main road that was chock full of awesome retro looking signs. All three of the above signs are located very close to each other and they all kick ass. I've always loved the huge top hat Arby's signs because of their sheer scale. I also love them because I can't really think of any point in time these signs actually were appropriate and didn't look out of place. The Star Cleaners sign is fantastically retro, right down to the years of paint chipping and decay. And the bowling sign is simple, thick and wonderful.
