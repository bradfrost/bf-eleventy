[![Ledonne Creative](https://bradfrost.com/images/ledonne.jpg)](http://ledonnecreative.com "Ledonne Creative") I recently had the opportunity to construct a website and blog for [Ledonne Creative](http://ledonnecreative.com "Ledonne Creative"), a web marketing firm in Pittsburgh, PA. Ledonne Creative specializes in search engine optimization, online marketing strategies, and design. Thus the design was nicely set up for me, all I needed to do was bust out the ole' Photoshop knives and carve it up. The main site is all Flash, leaving the blog section to do the heavy lifting from an SEO standpoint. For the Flash end of things, I mostly used Flash's built in tween class, and simply added some little animations for rollover states. Subtle, but effective. I also executed a PHP contact form for the site from within Flash, which was a first for me. In regards to [the blog](http://ledonnecreative.com/blog "Ledonne Creative Blog"), I simply modified the existing site design and placed it within Wordpress' architecture. The same arrows in the Flash site were regurgitated as list bullets and title headers, and Century Gothic (not your traditional web font) was used for the titles and some of the site nav. Since this blog will be used for SEO, I installed some of the most popular SEO plugins for Wordpress, including [Headspace 2](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/headspace2/ "Headspace 2") and [Google XML Sitemap Generator](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/ "Google XML Sitemap Generator"). Since the client knows all about optimization, these simple tools and tweaks will provide the necessary framework for the company to boost its rankings and provide some killer content. All in all I'm quite happy results for it being a quick and dirty job. I look forward to seeing what sort of helpful SEO and design tips Ledonne Creative writes about in the near future.
