I love the subway system in all honesty, but I'm sure everyone can agree its not the cleanest place in the world. Especially after my lovely experience at 8:30AM where a crazy guy shit his pants three feet away from me, then continued screaming. ♫ The best part of waking up, is crazy guy shitting his pants on the subway™.
