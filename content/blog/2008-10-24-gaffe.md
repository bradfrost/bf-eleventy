[![I heard the word \\'Gaffe\\' at most one other time before this election.](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/gaffe.jpg)](http://brad-frost.deviantart.com/art/Gaffe-101595145) I heard the word "gaffe" at most one other time before this election. This is true statement. I can't escape this word, no matter where I go to receive my news. People say it in casual conversation. Its amazing what power the media has to subliminally and NOT so subliminally introduce new words, phrases, ideas and ideals into our minds. Think about it, how often did we toss this word around before this election season? God bless America and Pump Demi Bold.
