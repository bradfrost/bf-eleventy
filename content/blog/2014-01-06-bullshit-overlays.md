[![Overlay Bullshit](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/overlay-bullshit-small.gif)](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/overlay-bullshit.gif) It's 2014, and every website I visit hits me with some nonsense overlay. **Stop  it.** I'm sure they're effective. And I could get people on the street to take my survey by threatening them with a claw hammer. That would be pretty effective too. Check out [Tab Closed; Didn't Read](http://tabcloseddidntread.com/) by [Andy Beaumont](http://blog.andybeaumont.com/) ([@drcongo](http://twitter.com/drcongo)), and [read his thoughts](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/a30bbe8b54a5) on all of this nonsense. For more of my thoughts on this, check out [Death to Bullshit](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/death-to-bullshit-at-creative-mornings/).
