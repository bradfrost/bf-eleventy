Brad Frost's Blog was my first blog theme, which featured a unique design of a large mouth. The header and footer's position was fixed with the content scrolling inside the mouth.

The blog was featured in Smashing Magazine's [Now More Than Ever: 50 More Excellent Blog Designs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/08/now-more-than-ever-50-more-excellent-blog-designs/ "Now More Than Ever: 50 More Excellent Blog Designs"). It was even used as the post thumbnail for the article. 

In addition to Smashing Magazine, the blog was [featured](http://www.cssbake.com/ingredients/navigation/brad-frosts-blog/) [on](http://www.lifewithinapage.com/2009/07/weve-all-travelled-across-web-and-weve.html) [many](http://designartwall.com/blog/23/fantastic-blog-website-designs) [CSS](http://fireflystream.com/node/100) [and](http://www.httpartist.com/beta/trends/inspirations/871-50-excellent-blog-designs.html) [design](http://www.pureblogging.com/2008/05/26/blog-designs-that-stand-out/) [galleries](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-latest-beautiful-and-enticing-blog-designs/).
