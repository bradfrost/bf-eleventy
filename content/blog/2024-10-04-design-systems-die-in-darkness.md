When you don't hear from teams using your design system, we've learned over the years that it's typically not a sign of "everything is going great" but "something is probably wrong."  
  
We teach our client teams to be very skeptical about silence, and teach them to be proactive about reaching out to the teams they serve. How's it going? What are you up to? How can we help? What are you running into? What can we be doing better to support you? We help our clients set up the right collaborative channels, model the process, and frankly help our teams embody the vibes of a friendly and supportive design system team.
