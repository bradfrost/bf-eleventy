**TL;DR:** **our Black Friday sale starts this Friday November 28th and runs through Friday December 5th. We'll be offering two deals: A MEGA BUNDLE with all of our courses for $1000 and a Subatomic + Atomic Design Bundle for $500.[Sign up for our newsletter](https://bradfrost.com/newsletter/) to get the details on Friday.** The ceremonial Black Friday dance One of my first jobs was making e-commerce websites for NYC fashion companies. Black Friday was always chaotic, involving late nights, take-out orders, and last-minute client demands (err, “requests”).  ![My old office at Pod1, a loft in Soho](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/02-pod1.jpg)The old Pod1 office in Soho, NYC. I have vivid memories of working late nights leading up to Black Friday. Equal parts stressful and exhilarating, I learned so much from these experiences. In later agency years, I’d work as part of giant campaigns (OMNI-CHANNEL! SYNERGY!) that began months in advance of this strange commercial holiday. And when my wife ran [her jewelry studio](https://frostfinery.com/), I’d help her with both physical and digital Black Friday promotions and holiday markets. As annoying as Black Friday can be, it’s a really important moment for small businesses. ![Melissa Frost at her Frost Finery table at a holiday market](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/November-24-2017-at-10_02AM-1024x827.jpg)My wonderful wife and her Frost Finery display during a holiday market. The ceremonial Black Friday dance is something I’m intimately familiar with, and It feels a bit weird to be back in this place. However, rather than selling Things, **it feels good to be in the game of selling _Knowledge_ and _Empowerment_** to help designers, developers, and teams make better work together. So if we can use the ritual of Black Friday to help level people up, we’re here for it. Here’s our game plan: **our Black Friday sale will run Friday November 28th to Friday December 5th, and will feature two big deals**. We’re sharing them now in case you need to the ceremonial approval dance. Here are the sales we’ll be running: MEGA BUNDLE: all courses for $1000! We admit it: we just like saying the words “MEGA BUNDLE”. Get all of our courses (an $1875 value) for one heavily-discounted price of $1000. The Mega Bundle includes all of our current and upcoming courses:
 
   * [Subatomic: The Complete Guide To Design Tokens](https://designtokenscourse.com/)
   * [Atomic Design Certification Course](https://atomicdesigncourse.com/) preorder
   * Our new [AI & Design Systems Course](https://aianddesign.systems/) preorder
 
Subatomic + Atomic Design courses for $500 We’re also offering our courses **[Subatomic: The Complete Guide To Design Tokens](https://designtokenscourse.com/)** AND our **[Atomic Design Certification Course](https://atomicdesigncourse.com/)** together for $500, a savings of 45%. Our Subatomic course will help you master design tokens, and our Atomic Design course will help you apply design system best practices at your organization. This is a fantastic opportunity to level up you and your team’s design system skills, and we won't be running this heavy of a sale any other time during the year. For those in the US, we hope you’re gearing up for the holidays and spending time with people you love. THANK YOU so much for all of your continued support; it really means the world to us!
