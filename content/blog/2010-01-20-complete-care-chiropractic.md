Dr. Ben Swacha is a passionate chiropractor in Owasso, OK. He just opened up a practice and wanted a strong brand identity and a usable website to help communicate to new and existing patients.

My wife and I were responsible for developing a brand identity that reinforced Ben's passion for chiropractic, nutrition and natural healing. The strong organic logo and theme reflects Ben's passion for health.

Digital strategy for a new business is always fun. Google Local would be an essential tool for maximizing exposure, so we optimized the listing with hours, photos, videos, reviews and more. Youtube was used as a repository for Ben's glowing patient testimonials. A Facebook fan page was set up to post regularly updated information about health, events and more.

The Wordpress-powered site features an events calendar, newsletter tool, dynamic video gallery page, online appointment request form and doctor's journal. These features make the site a great resource for new and existing patients.
