In [Responsive Design Workflow](http://bdconf.com/2012/orlando/schedule#stephenhay), [Stephen Hay](http://www.the-haystack.com/) ([@stephenhay](http://twitter.com/stephenhay)) talks how we have to adapt our workflow as well as we adapt our experiences.

  * The landscape has changed, but our workflows have not. We need to change that.
  * Updating Photoshop documents for web designs is immensely inefficient, especially for responsive designs. 
  * Design from the content out. Content and form are lovers, their love-child is design. **Design is simply not a sauce you put on top.**
  * A great exercise is asking "what is the message that needs to be communicated if I was ONLY able to provide them with unstyled HTML?" This forces us to prioritize. 
  * We refer to anything that isn't desktop as "mobile". See also [Desknots](http://globalmoxie.com/blog/desknots.shtml).
  * Interaction Designer - main wireframe. Every decision that gets made throughout the chain influences the interaction design. **Interaction design isn't wireframes.** Wireframes reduce visual design to decoration, simply a coloring book exercise. It reduces everyone's work.
  * There's no such thing as a perfect process. Pragmatism is essential for evolving process for responsive design. 
  * We're not designing pages. **We're designing systems of components.**
  * Plain HTML works on your phone. JOB'S DONE!
  * The device landscape is constantly changing. Properly structured content is portable to future platforms.
  * **Zero interface thinking:** everything we introduce has the potential to ruin everything. Ask: Is this absolutely necessary?
  * Version control, preprocessors, frameworks, templates, etc can make responsive process more effecient, but be careful when you introduce them into your workflow. 

Stephen's Responsive Workflow

  1. **Content Inventory** \- establish and describe the content. This gives you your raw materials
  2. **Content reference wireframes** \- establish rough responsive wireframes in HTML. Allows for really fast iterations.
  3. **Design in text (structured content)** \- establishes content hierarchy and structure. Easily revisable.
  4. **Linear Design** \- Test out the plain jane structured content in HTML in the browser.
  5. **Breakpoint graph** \- display visually where the breakpoints happen
  6. **Design for various breakpoints** \- Start with the small screen first, then expand until it looks like shit. TIME FOR A BREAKPOINT!
  7. **HTML design prototype** \- If w'ere not delivering designs in PS, what do we deliver? Clients wants PS because they're used to it. Create HTML CSS, and maybe a bit of JS
  8. **Present prototype screenshots** \- It's part of a presentation psychology - Presenting static "impressions" of the design across the different breakpoints allows you to stay ahead of your client. 
  9. **Present prototype after revisions** \- Once revisions have been made, you can show the design in action
  10. **Document for production** \- Deliver a style guide along with the production code.
