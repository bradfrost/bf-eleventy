**We’re thrilled to announce our new online course:**  [**AI & Design Systems**](https://aianddesign.systems)! You can [preorder the course now for $500](https://aianddesign.systems/#order). [![Logo for AI and Design Systems, a new online course from Southleft and Brad Frost Web. aianddesign.systems](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CleanShot-2025-11-23-at-22.13.51-1024x575.png)](https://aianddesign.systems/#order)   
**Generative AI is here** , it’s increasingly powerful, and**…it can make a huge mess**. Thankfully, design systems deliver quality UI infrastructure and crucial organizational context that can help keep AI on the rails. **AI and design systems are a powerful combination** that can help your team capitalize on these new technologies without sacrificing years of hard-earned product quality. Our new course will teach you how to thoughtfully pair AI and design systems together to take your digital organization to the next level. To bring this course to life, **we’re partnering with our friend, long-time collaborator, and AI & design systems expert, [TJ Pitre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpitre/) from [Southleft](https://southleft.com/)**. Both together and separately, we’ve helped some of the largest companies in the world create & evolve design systems, establish more collaborative processes, and adopt AI & other emerging technologies. We’re thrilled teach with and learn from TJ! Why we're creating this course The mere mention of AI is extremely polarizing at this moment in time, so I made a video to explain why we're creating this course, how we think about AI, and how we're going about creating this course.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL1h_n6jRlE  We feel it's really important to **treat AI with simultaneous curiosity and skepticism**.  ![treat AI with simultaneous curiosity and skepticism. ](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CleanShot-2025-11-24-at-09.37.56-1024x575.png) There are some interesting, powerful, and promising things around this new technology. **AND** there are some underwhelming, alarming, and downright lousy aspects to this technology.  With this course, we want to serve as clear-eyed guides for digital professionals who are under a lot of pressure to figure out this present moment. We're excited to teach people important concepts as well as demonstrate how to pragmatically and practically use AI and design systems together to make better digital products.  Let’s learn together as a community! It feels like the future is rapidly unfolding before our eyes; new technologies, tools, techniques, and resources are released every day. If you feel overwhelmed, you’re certainly not alone! That’s why **we’re creating an AI & Design Systems Slack community.** People who preorder the course can join a community of passionate fellow travelers; together we’ll share resources, tips, techniques, triumphs, and tribulations. The course will provide important framing, foundational concepts, real-world stories, and sturdy techniques, but it take all of us working together to master this ever-changing landscape. Huzzah!
