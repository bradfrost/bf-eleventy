In addition to stuffing our faces with cookies, [Ian](https://ianfrostweather.com/) and I were hard at work over the holidays creating our****[design tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/).**I'm freaking thrilled that we published 2 hours of preorder-exclusive video content, shared several dozen links, and included actionable steps people can take while we develop the full course content.** We put together [a quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkihWrBbhGE) walking through what we’re covering in the course and what you can expect by [preordering](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkihWrBbhGE  Now that we have that stuff in place, we’re now jumping into producing the honest-to-goodness course content. We're freaking PUMPED. We’re going to be iteratively publishing all videos and materials as soon as they’re ready; as soon as we have Chapter 1 done — or even chunks of Chapter 1 — we'll be publishing them to the course.  I [did a similar rolling thing when I wrote my book](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/self-publishing-a-book-for-fun-and-profit/), but the big difference here is that unlike a book that needs to eventually reach a "FINAL.pdf" state, the course can be iterated over as we develop it and beyond. I _really_ dig this format and feel like we're finally able to go as deep as we'd like. So yeah! If you want 2+ hours of ready-to-go exclusive videos, first access to content, help us shape the course, and to save over 25% off the full price, you can [preorder our design tokens course right here](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order).  While we have a lot of things in place already, this course is still very much a wet ball of clay. We'd love to hear where you're at in your design tokens journey, what you and your team are wrestling with, and what you'd love to see from the course. Email [courses@bradfrost.com](mailto:courses@bradfrost.com) and we’ll respond, honest!
