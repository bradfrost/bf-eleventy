We're so freaking excited to announce that we've reached a big milestone in our [Subatomic design tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/): we released our battle-tested design token architecture for both Figma and code! We put together a video tour of what's included: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24ZUKWssek  We've had the great pleasure to collaborate with the fantastic human, designer, and educator [Molly Hellmuth](https://www.uiprep.com/), who runs the [UI Prep](https://www.uiprep.com/) training platform and popular design newsletter. Molly helped us bring our design token architecture to life for our course's demo organization: the hottest new ice cream company sweeping the world called _Frost'd Tokens!_ **We created 4 themes — Vanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate, and Dark Chocolate — and demonstrate the token architecture through three separate product UIs.** In addition to validating the architecture through product UIs, **we've provided thorough token documentation (which in our experience always falls by the wayside when focusing on building the actual token architecture!), and even include a playground to help people understand, test, and review the system.** ![Design token architecture for 4 themes documented in Figma](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-25-at-2.30.54 PM-1024x642.png) This architecture isn't just a collection of Figma and code assets though; it's an accompaniment to the many hours of in-depth video lessons contained within the course. **Chapter 4 alone has over 2 hours of video lessons dedicated to building this design token system from the ground up in both Figma and code**.  Preorder and save $150 With the release of this architecture, we've increased the preorder price by $100. **The good news is that if you[preorder the course now](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order), you'll get access to this architecture, over 5 hours of video lessons, and _still_ save $150 off of the final price**.  We're now entering the home stretch! We're cranking through the remaining chapters and will be putting a bow on everything. We're so freaking excited. To top it all off, we continue to get such great feedback from our growing community of token enthusiasts: 

> Guys, I can’t imagine how many hours you have put into this course. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with all of us, I’m about half way through chapter four and it’s so thorough! Exactly what I needed at just the right time 🤟 David Byrne It is one of the best courses available online these days. Thanks for putting such a great effort into producing it. Maurizio Vaggi We hope you consider [preordering the course](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order), and as always just let us know if you have any questions about any of this!
