Kabiri is a jewellery boutique in the UK featuring jewellery (they spell it like that over there) from tons of famous jewellery designers from all over the world. Pod1 was responsible for establishing the brand identity online, setting up an online store and blog.

I was responsible for creating a custom Magento theme and configuring the store. I worked with an international team to complete the project. The design was quite complex with many custom pages but the effort was well worth it. The result is definitely a high-quality marketplace for some pretty wild jewelry.
