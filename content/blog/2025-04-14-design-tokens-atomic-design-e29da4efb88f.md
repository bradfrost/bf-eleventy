One of the most-asked questions I get is "What would you change about [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)?" [My answer is](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/extending-atomic-design/): I would probably talk about design tokens!

> In the world of UI, **design tokens are subatomic particles**. The design token `color-brand-blue` is a critical ingredient of a UI, but it’s not exactly functional on its own. It needs to be applied to an [“atom”](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) (such as the background color of a button) in order to come to life.
 
 I love being able to create these at-a-glance visuals to help people understand these oft-misunderstood conventions and implementations. Creating our [Subatomic Design Tokens Course](https://designtokenscourse.com/) has given me the opportunity to finally bring all of these concepts together into a cohesive narrative. It feels really good! If you want to learn about this stuff in extreme detail, [consider ordering our course](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order)!
