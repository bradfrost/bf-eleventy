Neat! Well, guess it's time to really learn grid. I've been in so many of Rachel Andrew's and [Jen Simmon](http://jensimmons.com/)'s conference talks, but have never been in a position to put pen to paper and actually play with grid on my own. Until now! I'll be using their fantastic resources to learn: 
 
   * Rachel's [Grid By Example](http://gridbyexample.com/)
   * [Jen Simmon's Labs](http://labs.jensimmons.com/)
 
Let the fun begin!
