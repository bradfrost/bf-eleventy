The team who redesigned the University of Dammam website used [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) to construct the front-end and to use it as a living style guide for the site. More from the article: 

> An important deliverable for this project was a front end style guide that could be used to test the responsive nature of the site and serve as a reference for future UD web projects. We wanted to identify common functionality and design elements from our wireframes that could be developed into reusable components. This was done with the help of Pattern Lab. It uses atomic design to break down interfaces into their individual building blocks.
