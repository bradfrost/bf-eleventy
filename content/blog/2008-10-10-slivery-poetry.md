[![Sliver Poetry](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/sliver_poetry.jpg)](http://sliverpoetry.com "Sliver Poetry") [Sliver Poetry](http://sliverpoetry.com "Sliver Poetry") is a collection of free verse poetry written by poet Seth Pesek. Seth needed a simple website where he could easily add sample poems from his book and update purchasing and contact information with ease. Wordpress was the right tool for the job and all I needed to do was create a quick skin and manipulate the default template. This site is the definition bare bones. Simplicity was the key and because of that I got a couple CSS headaches along the way. I'm currently working on a few personal sites right now that I will post updates on when they get to the proper stage in development.
