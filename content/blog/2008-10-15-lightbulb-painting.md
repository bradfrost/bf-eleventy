[![Lightbulb Painting](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/lightning_painting.jpg)](http://brad-frost.deviantart.com/art/Lightbulb-Painting-100779747) Several months ago, I started a painting based on [a doodle I created](https://bradfrost.com/blog/lightbulb-doodle-and-midnight-spaghetti "Lightbulb Doodle") during a meeting. I have finally completed it, and is currently hanging on the wall of our apartment. The dimensions are 36"x48" and was created by nailing together four smaller canvases. I really enjoyed working on a piece this big and look forward to creating another painting on a similar or larger scale soon.
