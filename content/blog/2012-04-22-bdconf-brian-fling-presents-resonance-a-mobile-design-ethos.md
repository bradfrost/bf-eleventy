In [Resonance: A Mobile Design Ethos](http://bdconf.com/2012/orlando/schedule#fling), [Brian Fling](http://pinchzoom.com/) ([@fling](http://twitter.com/fling)) explains how to create meaningful mobile products that have the power to change people’s lives. I unfortunately got to the session a bit late because lunch ran over. Here are my notes I caught:

  * Great ideas and innovation aren't enough. You need to articulate your vision in order to create great design.
  * Stay true to design principles in the face of fickle clients.
  * Brian used an example on his work for the [BBC iPlayer](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-iplayer/id416580485?mt=8) to demonstrate how users just want the content to be clear. Clients and teams tend to overcomplicate simple problems and often create worse user experiences as a result.
  * **Focus on the clarity of design, not on the bells and whistles.** Brian explained how after [Nike Better World](http://www.nikebetterworld.com/about) came out, everyone got on the parallax bandwagon. His client wanted to incorporate parallax into their design project, so they spent many hours of testing and prototyping a parallax version of the design. It was a costly process and they found that it didn't test well with users.
  * Less Is More. Constantly refine and focus on keeping the experience very very simple.
  * Designing experiences that are meant to work across designs

10 ways to access an experience

  1. **Universal app** -- an experience that's offered across a multitude of channels and devices. Brian used [NPR's COPE strategy](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/10/13/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/) as an example.
  2. **Native application** -- an app built specifically for a native platform. Proprietary technology isn't going anywhere and can provide cutting edge functionality
  3. **Native Hybrid App** -- a combination of native and web views
  4. **HTML5 hybrid app** -- a native shell whose contents are built primarily in web technologies
  5. **Responsive Web app** -- An app that is created using responsive web design techniques. (I typically use [AudioVroom](http://developers.facebook.com/html5/blog/post/4/) as an example of a responsive app)
  6. **Mobile Web App** -- An app written in web technologies and deployed on the web
  7. **Desktop Web App** -- An app written in web technologies that are only optimized for desktop experiences. The experience is rendered as-is for mobile browsers
  8. **Responsive Web Site** -- a site built using fluid grids, flexible images and media queries and hopefully good progressive enhancement techniques
  9. **Desktop Web Site** -- a site optimized only for large desktop screens
  10. **Mobile Web Site** -- a site optimized specifically for small mobile browsers.

Mobile Design

  * Building a design language is a mandatory step in order to create coherent cross-platform experiences.
  * When we talk about design, we talk about resonating with people.
