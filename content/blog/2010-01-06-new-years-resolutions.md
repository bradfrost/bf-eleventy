2010 is promising to be a fantastic year, however its going to take some time to get rolling with it personally. Unfortunately, I still have stuff to clean off my plate from last year, but once that happens hopefully I'll be on my way to being happier and healthier. Here are some things that are going to take up a lot of my focus this year:

### Recording an Album

My wonderful wife and I moved out of Manhattan this year and into Brooklyn where we have a little more space. So we converted our second bedroom into a recording studio, but its not quite there yet. We've got the beginnings to quite a few songs, definitely enough to make an album, so this will be a major priority to start developing our sound. We're both really excited about it.

### Getting Healthy

2009 hurt. Pushing my self to the limits, biting off WAY more than I could chew, and simply working myself to death took its toll on me, both mentally and physically. With this in mind, its an extremely high goal of mine this year to become healthier, manage my time better, and focus on what's really important. This includes going to the gym, finding a good chiropractor in the city (suggestions?), working less, doing less freelance work and sleeping a lot more.

### Reconnecting

While not the most social animal out there, I feel like I've lost touch with a lot of people and need to do better with staying in the loop. Much of it has to do with the "work myself to death" problem highlighted before. 

### Playing More

A lot of people have the exact opposite problem as me. They can't pry themselves away from video games, tv, whatever and do work or personal projects. I'm pretty sure I'm in the market for a video game console not because of the entertainment value it provides, but because it will provide an excuse to not do anything for a couple hours. Weird I know, but it needs to happen. 

### New Year to look forward to

I'm very much excited about developing professionally, artistically and musically over the course of this year, I just need to focus on keeping control of my life and not run at such a breakneck speed. It will require me saying NO to things, which will be the hardest part, but I'm hopeful that 2010 will be a great year.

Wishing everyone a happy, healthy and prosperous 2010.
