Quietly  
I slip out of bed  
Taking care so as not to wake my daughter snuggled next to me  
Another nightmare, I presume  
She claimed comfort once again in her spot between mom and dad  
  
Downstairs I tiptoe  
My mind calm and focused  
Eager to tackle what lies ahead  
But first, coffee  
  
The grinder punctures the silence  
Its sound tempered only by the potent aroma  
Of the dried exotic beans  
The scent jolts my mind and my senses  
  
My gaze shifts out the window  
Emerging dawn reveals a frost  
Surely one of the last of the season  
Each blade of grass captured in glass  
  
The frost crystalizes  
Both nature and time  
It is both singular and infinite  
Revealing The Truth  
  
The frost is temporary  
Like Everything  
This silent teacher gently reminds  
I am grateful for its lesson  
  
I leave the tranquil landscape to its work  
Attention shifts back to the quiet rumble of the bubbling brew  
My thankful mind   
Contemplating the glory of the universe  
  
As if right on cue  
My brain digs into the depths of my memory  
To produce a soundtrack  
To this placid morning lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ANvps4qg0k  Brains are so freaking weird.  
Time to start my day.
