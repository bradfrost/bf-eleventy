Raw-dogging websites: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`. No frameworks, no CMSes, no build steps, no nuthin'. Sure, you can call it a static site, but even those tend to be compiled by sophisticated tooling behind the scenes. And also, c'mon, gotta get with the [parlance of the times](https://www.travelweek.ca/news/airlines/what-is-raw-dogging-and-why-are-people-doing-it-on-planes/).  I started my career raw-fdogging websites, but I've had some really great and recent success with creating and iterating over a simple static website. It is extraordinarily liberating. Yes, there are some ergonomic inefficiencies, but at the end of the day it comes out in the wash. You might have to copy-and-paste some HTML, but in my experience I'd spend that much time or more debugging a broken build or dependency hell.  I raw-dogged the [Frostapalooza website](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/) (including all of the way-more-involved musician-facing pages) for over a year and it was a freaking treat. A+++ would raw-dog a website again.
