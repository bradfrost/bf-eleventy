[![Brad Frost Profile Pic](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2323/2250253918_71580292f6.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/brad_frost/2250253918/ "Brad Frost Profile Picture on Flickr") So I designed this to be my new profile picture for my [ever-expanding](http://flickr.com/photos/brad_frost/ "Brad Frost's Flickr") [collection](http://digg.com/users/ienjoyhotsoup "Brad Frost's Digg") of [social](http://www.last.fm/user/brad_frost/ "Brad Frost's Last.fm") [networking](http://www.myspace.com/ienjoyhotsoup "Brad Frost's Myspace") [websites](http://ienjoyhotsoup.imeem.com/ "Brad Frost's Imeem"). I hand drew a picture from a photo and messed around in Photoshop. I'm not the best at Photoshop, so I'd really like some honest constructive criticism. Hit me up with a comment with what you think of it. Thanks
