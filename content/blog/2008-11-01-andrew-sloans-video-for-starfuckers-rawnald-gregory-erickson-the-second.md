One of my good friends Andrew Sloan has produced an animated video for Portland, Oregon-based indie rock band [Starfucker](http://www.myspace.com/starfuckerss "Starfucker Myspace"). The video was created in 3D modelling program Maya. It is absolutely beautiful and captivating. It fits the song's vibe so well. Here is the video:  The video is currently featured on Pitchfork TV. I'm very happy for Andrew's success and hope's he keeps producing awesome shit for me to enjoy. Check out his website for [Monstrous Media](http://monstrousmedia.com/ "Monstrous Media"). I have worked with Andrew on a previous animated short film called [The Odd Ballroom](https://bradfrost.com/blog/the-odd-ballroom "The Odd Ballroom - Brad Frost's Blog"). Keep it up!
