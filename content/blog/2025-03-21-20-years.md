20 YEARS AGO TODAY, Melissa and I started dating. I'm 40, which means that I've now spent more of my life with Melissa than without. This will be true for the rest of our lives, and I will love every minute of life because I'm with her. ![Young Brad and Melissa](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-1024x768.png)
