The frontend considerations of an organization are many. We're [overwhelmed by tools, processes, workflows, styles, opinions, and ever-changing best practices](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/i-have-no-idea-what-the-hell-i-am-doing/). In order for frontend teams to create cohesive, consistent work, it's important for organizations to establish some guidelines for how to go about creating frontend work. That's why I put together the [Frontend Guidelines Questionnaire](https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire). [![bradfrost:frontend-guidelines-questionnaire](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bradfrostfrontend-guidelines-questionnaire.png)](https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire) The questionnaire runs through the many aspects of frontend development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, tooling, and more. Most likely teams will have answers to many of these questions. And if they don't, perhaps it will spark conversations. Or perhaps At the end of the day, I see this as a tool to help teams codify important principles, best practices, workflows, and more for the benefit of the work. So [take it](https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire), modify it, extend it, and use it to move your organization in the right direction. I'm fully aware the questionnaire isn't as thorough as it could be (although I'm hesitant to overwhelm people with minutiae), so if you have suggestions for additional questions/categories, edits, resources, etc, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire/issues). Thanks so much!
