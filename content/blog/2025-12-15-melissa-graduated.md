**MY WIFE GRADUATED AND GOT HER MASTERS IN MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING AND ART THERAPY!** I am so massively proud of her! ![Melissa smiling holding her diploma while wearing her cap and gown](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/melissa-772x1024.png) Melissa has busted her ass and has demonstrated superhuman levels of grit and determination over the last four and a half years. She's endured more hardship since the start of her journey than some people do in an entire lifetime, and she's done it all while continuing to be an utterly exemplary human being. She is such an inspiration to me, and our daughter is so lucky to have such a role model for a mom. ![Melissa in her cap and gown smiling with Ella and Brad](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/melissa-graduation-EDIT-883x1024.jpg) Melissa is so gifted in so many areas, and it's been so inspiring to see her deploy all of her talents and amazing qualities for such a noble mission. I'm so excited for her next chapter, and also excited for her to get some well-deserved rest! I love you so much, Melissa. CONGRATULATIONS!
