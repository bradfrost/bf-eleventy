It's always great to hear Ethan's super smart thoughts, and his thoughts on container queries are of course on point. I've been rounding up [resources on element/container queries](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#element-queries) on This Is Responsive for years now, and hope that words from prominent folks like Ethan keep the conversation going and make container queries a reality!
