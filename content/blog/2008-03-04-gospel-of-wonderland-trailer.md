I've spent the last few days recording score music for my my friend [Sean's](http://www.seaneisele.com/SeanEisele/Home.html "Sean Eisele's Films") first feature length film, [Gospel of Wonderland](http://www.myspace.com/gospelofwonderland "Gospel of Wonderland Myspace"). I have only seen clips, but it looks fantastic. I am constantly impressed with Sean's ability as a filmmaker, which is why I'm proud to assist in the process. My role was to create several ambient tracks to serve as the main theatrical theme music for the film. The film is still in post-production, but hopefully I'll be able to post a link soon when the film debuts. Until then, here is the theatrical trailer for Gospel of Wonderland.
