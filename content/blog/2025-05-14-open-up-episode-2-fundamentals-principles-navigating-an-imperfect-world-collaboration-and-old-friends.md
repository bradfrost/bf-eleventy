https://youtu.be/bquVF5Cibaw?si=fU2FBf5Rf2UxbDra  I'm late in posting this because boy oh boy, there's been a lot going on. But Episode 2 of our show [Open Up](https://smashingconf.com/open-up) is out! Geoff and I tackled some great questions and covered a lot of ground in this episode, including: 
 
   * What should designers & developers focus on? 
   * Will AI take our jobs?
   * Focusing on fundamentals
   * Embodying principles in both work and life
   * Navigating an imperfect world
   * Taking jobs that don't align with your values
   * Reflections on how collaboration has changed over time
   * Enduring friendships with old collaborators!
 
Great conversation! [Join us for the next episode on June 11th](https://smashingconf.com/open-up), and if you'd like us to weigh in on your situation, feel free to [write to us right here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfn4s1eBakC9cHA1J1zhbDuUPyiuzZT1RE6C--kCQR8IBFlaA/viewform)!
