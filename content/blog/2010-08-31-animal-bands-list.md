## The Story

This list was generated on a long 7 hour drive from New York City to Oil City, PA between me, my cousin Zach and my wife. Unfortunately, this was some time ago and we didn't really write anything down until after the fact. As a result, this might not be completely exhaustive. That's where you come in. Feel free to suggest.

However, a very simple rule applies. **Bands/artists can't be TOO obscure**. There are probably thousands of bands with animal names, but unless they've achieved some level of notoriety they can't be on the list. Any obscure ones that you see in the list were thought of by us in our initial brainstorm.
