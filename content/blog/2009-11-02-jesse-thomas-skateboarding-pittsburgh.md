My cousin Jesse Thomas has been skateboarding since the early days of the sport. Growing up we've always been impressed with his stories and scars, but most importantly his style. Over the years skateboarding got bigger and more visible, but Jesse stays true to his roots and hones his craft as only someone with his amount of experience can do. This video is the latest promo for the Head Board Shop in Pittsburgh. I may be biased but Jesse really stands out in his ability to go huge and nail some pretty amazing runs.
