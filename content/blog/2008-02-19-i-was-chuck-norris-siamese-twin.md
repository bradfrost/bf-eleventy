![I Was Chuck Norris' Siamese Twin Weekly World News Cover](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2276617408_4d38d19bc0.jpg?v=0) This was a school project I did when I was first learning Photoshop. I recently stumbled onto it hiding in my folders and thought that I'd share it. *Important Note* This project was done almost 3 years ago, before the Chuck Norris revival movement hit full swing.
