Woohoo! I am so incredibly excited to announce that [Frostapalooza](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/) is now live! The show is on August 17th at Mr. Smalls Theatre in Pittsburgh, PA, and you can see the event on [Mr. Smalls' website](https://mrsmalls.com/events/frostapalooza/) and [get tickets at Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/16005F70D2B839CC). Please get your tickets and get 'em soon; I'm hoping to sell the place out in order to maximize the money raised for two great causes and also to maximize the party! I was recently talking with [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/) and Dave on the ShopTalk Show and they did a pretty good job pitching it: I mean, just look at the[ epic Frostapalooza concert poster](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/) designed by [Roberlan](https://www.roberlan.com/): [![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-700x1082.png)](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/) To say I'm excited about this show is a severe understatement. For the past 6 months, over 40 musicians spread across states and continents have been planning, scheming, and practicing for one epic night of music and shenanigans. It's been so incredibly hard to keep all of the great stuff that everyone's been producing under my hat, but that's what needs to happen to make the show have its desired effect. So yeah! Come to Frostapalooza. [Get your tickets here](https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/16005F70D2B839CC). You'll have a great time!
