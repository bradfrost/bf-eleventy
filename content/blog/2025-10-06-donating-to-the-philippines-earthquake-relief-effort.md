Last week, the island of Cebu in The Philippines was [hit with a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/g-s1-91398/dozens-killed-earthquake-philippines). We were on a call with our friend and colleague, Nicole, when the earthquake happened and she had to rush to get to safety. Thankfully she and her family are okay, but the quake caused severe damage and killed dozens of people. People in Cebu and neighboring islands need help, and we’d love it if you’d consider donating directly to the relief efforts here:
 
   * [Philippines Red Cross Paypal](https://bit.ly/prcpaypal)
   * [Global Giving](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/philippines-earthquake-relief-fund/)
 
In addition to donating directly, **we’re donating 15% of all purchases of our**[**Subatomic Design Dokens Course**](https://designtokenscourse.com/)**and**[**Atomic Design Certification Course**](https://atomicdesigncourse.com/)**(preorder) for the next week**. I wish we could help even more, your purchase will help a lot of people out.
