[![Interview with The Next Web](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-15-at-3.11.31-PM-650x434.png)](http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/06/tumblr-tuesday-celebrating-the-wtf-of-qr-codes-and-the-mobile-web/) I recently had the opportunity to do an [interview with The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/06/tumblr-tuesday-celebrating-the-wtf-of-qr-codes-and-the-mobile-web/), where I got to talk about [WTF QR Codes](http://wtfqrcodes.com/) (of course), but also about [WTF Mobile Web](http://wtfmobileweb.com/) and what goes into a good & bad mobile web experience.

> The biggest thing that makes a mobile web experience terrible is not achieving content parity. Whether you’re presented with a message saying “Sorry, your device is not supported”, or you’re forced to download an app, or you’re redirected to the mobile site’s homepage, or you just get a fraction of the real content, you’re not getting what you asked for. That pisses you off. You’re arbitrarily being penalized for the device you happen to be browsing with. 

It's a lot of fun managing these sites and even more fun collaborating on them with [Craig](http://twitter.com/cvilly) and [Jen](http://twitter.com/jensimmons). And while it's fun to harp on these bad experiences, the goal is to establish best practices by demonstrating what not to do. It takes a lot of work to make a good experience, so pointing out common pitfalls can hopefully prevent the same mistakes from happening over and over again.
