Big news: Pittsburgh finally has an open device lab! Now Pittsburgh web and app developers have a place to go test their creations on a plethora of devices large and small, new and old, and (hopefully) everything in between. The device lab is graciously hosted at the [Catapult Coworking space](http://catapultpgh.org/) on 4327 Butler St in Lawrenceville. You can swing by anytime between 9AM and 5PM to use the device lab. For more information, email [inbox@catapultpgh.org](mailto:inbox@catapultpgh.org) or get in touch with [@CatapultPGH](https://twitter.com/CatapultPGH) on Twitter. Contributing Devices Here's the deal: the device lab needs to grow. Right now it’s only got a handful of devices in it, and it’s hungry for more. ![Pittsburgh Device Lab initial devices](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/11999395766_c50023e682_z.jpg) **Have an old device lying around?** Consider donating it to the Pittsburgh Open Device Lab. **Upgrading to the latest hotness?** Contribute your old device to the lab. **Want to buy a device for the lab** [on the cheap?](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/) Your purchase would be greatly appreciated. **Device manufacturer?** Consider donating to make sure the talented Pittsburgh [developer](http://builtinpgh.com/companies/) [community](http://www.refreshpittsburgh.org/) is supporting your devices. I’m really excited about this. I can see the device lab being an amazing resource for Pittsburgh’s development community, and hope that we’ll see it grow and evolve in the coming months, with help from [Elliot](https://twitter.com/elliottwilliams), Catapult, and most importantly the help from the community.
