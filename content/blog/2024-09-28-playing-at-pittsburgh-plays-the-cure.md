I'm happy to announce that I'll be playing bass as part of the [Pittsburgh Plays](https://www.pittsburghplays.com/) concert series on December 14th at [The Roxian Theatre](https://www.roxiantheatre.com/).  From [Pittsburgh Play's website](https://www.pittsburghplays.com/about-1):

> Pittsburgh Plays is a semi-annual event that offers music lovers of all kinds the chance to experience the talents of local artists through the coveted music of legendary performers who have influenced generations. The mission of Pittsburgh Plays is to build community within the local music scene by connecting artists, challenging them to adapt and perform with new people and go on to continue to collaborate in other ways outside of Pittsburgh Plays events. Previous events have tributed Tom Petty (2018), Paul McCartney (2019), Fleetwood Mac (2021), and Queen (2022).
 
 It's very much in the spirit of [Frostapalooza](https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/)!  For this year's show, musicians will be playing the music of [The Cure](https://www.thecure.com/). They have some incredibly catchy tunes with some amazing bass lines ([Close To Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjvfIJstWeg) is definitely my favorite) and I'm stoked to connect with other local musicians and have a blast.  While I'm playing bass at the show, I couldn't help myself but record some drums to Just Like Heaven since it has so many wonderful little rolls and splash hits peppered throughout. Tons of fun! If you're in Pittsburgh on December 14th, you should come [get some tickets](https://concerts.livenation.com/pittsburgh-plays-the-cure-mc-kees-rocks-pennsylvania-12-14-2024/event/16006109C1C32B63), throw on some eyeliner, and come have some fun!
