This is why I love the Web. In a Twitter conversation sparked by someone looking for resources on style guides, we ended up in a conversation that led to a simple suggestion: 

> [@Falkowski](https://twitter.com/Falkowski) [@anna_debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham) Hey you wanna put our heads together on this and make a site dedicated to this? Anna I know you had your bookmarks-- Brad Frost (@brad_frost) [November 14, 2014](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/533346314554458113)
 
 It seemed like only a few minutes had passed before [Anna](http://maban.co.uk/) set up an entire site and had the basic scaffolding in place. Because she's a genius like that. And as soon as the [repo](https://github.com/maban/styleguides) was up and running, all sorts of smart people came out of the woodwork: [Brendan Falkowski](https://twitter.com/Falkowski), [Susan Robertson](https://twitter.com/susanjrobertson), [Ian Feather](https://twitter.com/ianfeather), and [more](https://github.com/maban/styleguides/graphs/contributors). Pretty much within a day, a site was born. Introducing Styleguides.io [![Styleguides.io Homepage](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ember7-1024x702.png)](http://styleguides.io) [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io) is an open-source website for sharing resources about style guides: [articles](http://styleguides.io/articles.html), [books](http://styleguides.io/books.html), [talks](http://styleguides.io/talks.html), [podcasts](http://styleguides.io/podcasts.html), [tools](http://styleguides.io/tools.html), and [examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html). The hope is that it will become a hub for all things related to creating and maintaining [the various flavors of style guides](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guides/) out there. Why Style guides and pattern libraries are becoming increasingly essential tools for modern web design, development, and branding. It's been [said](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/) [before](http://lanyrd.com/2014/confabedu/sdfxyp/), but it's worth saying again: style guides promote consistency and cohesion, encourage collaboration, set up a shared vocabulary, make testing easier, and lay down a [future-friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/) foundation to modify and extend. There have been a few [resources](http://patternlab.io/resources.html) [out](https://gimmebar.com/collection/4ecd439c2f0aaad734000022/front-end-styleguides) [there](http://manuals.gravitydept.com/design/styleguides/resources) trying to round up resources about style guides, but they've all been individual efforts. Styleguides.io provides a unified place to keep track of all the smart thinking and smart examples going into these things. I know I'm excited! How Can I Help? You can join the growing number of [contributors](https://github.com/maban/styleguides/graphs/contributors) and help submit and manage these resources and make the site better. Or if you quickly want to share a link and/or are intimidated by Github (which I totally get), you can [fill out this handy form](https://bradfrost.wufoo.com/forms/add-resource-to-styleguidesio/) and we'll add it to the site for you. I'm super excited to see the site grow and evolve and contribute to a bigger conversation. And I'll also say I'm once again totally floored by how collaborative everyone's been getting the site off the ground. Once again I find myself [incredibly thankful for how collaborative and open](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-march-30) our community can be. So that's that. Go check out [styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/)!
