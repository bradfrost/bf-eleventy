[caption id="attachment_557" align="alignnone" width="650" caption="Wednesday #3"]![Wednesday #3](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/monday3-650x650.jpg)[/caption] This is the third installment of my "weekly" design series. I guess I should have been more realistic in regards to how consistent I would be with this project, but thankfully only a week slipped by. Blue, orange and concentric circles are in full effect here. These are a few of my favorite things.
