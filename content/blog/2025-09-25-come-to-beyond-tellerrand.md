Holy smokes, I am SO EXCITED to head to Berlin for [Beyond Tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.de/events/berlin-2025) taking place on November 5-7. Beyond Tellerrand is such a special event for me (it's where I first [introduced Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)!), and [Marc](https://marcthiele.de/) and I have spent the last number of months scheming all sorts of fun stuff for November. Here's why I'm so excited: Advanced Design Tokens workshop Ian and I are teaching our full-day [Advanced Design Tokens workshop](https://beyondtellerrand.de/events/berlin-2025/workshops/advanced-design-tokens) on November 5th! We'll be teaching attendees how to create sophisticated design token systems to create a thoughtful [separation of concerns](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-new-separation-of-concerns/) to help meet your [Multi-All-The-Things](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-multi-all-the-things-organization/) organization's multifarious design needs. We're bringing the whole kit and caboodle from our comprehensive [Subatomic Design Tokens course](https://designtokenscourse.com/), so expect to level up your design systems game and create architecture that supports wildly different design languages: ![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ice-cream-theme-switch-gif.gif) It's also going to be the most practical we'll get at the conference, so if you're looking for actionable things you can bring straight back to your work, I'd highly recommend you come to the workshop! A different kind of talk As I've heard Marc explain many times, "Beyond Tellerrand" translates to "Beyond the edge of the plate." That's why I love this conference so much; it introduces people to things beyond their regularly-scheduled programming and expands their horizons. It's with this in mind that I've been working for months on a much different type of talk than anything I've ever done. Here's the description:

> If you have any expectations about what this talk will be, please set them aside and keep your mind open. In this deeply personal, "and now for something completely different" talk, I will explore themes and share lessons about life, work, love, and existence. We are here. We are alive. 
 
 So yeah! Expect some weird. It'll be a ton of fun. Tellerrand Tunes! [![Tellerrand Tunes with Brad and Ian Frost](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png)](https://beyondtellerrand.de/events/berlin-2025/side-events/tellerrand-tunes) I'm freaking PUMPED for this. We are [hosting a jam session](https://beyondtellerrand.de/events/berlin-2025/side-events/tellerrand-tunes) that's woven into the after party on the first night of the conference. It's going to be part improvisational jam, part live band karaoke, and a whole lotta fun. Here's the scoop:
 
   * Anyone can participate! If interested, you can [register to play music with us](https://ti.to/beyondtellerrand/berlin-2025/with/qj2aedfkx0m) (registration is free and helps us get a sense of how many people are going to participate)
   * When you register, you can share which songs you'd be excited to play/sing and what role you'd play. If you want to belt out "I Love Rock and Roll", rap to California Love, rip a Van Halen guitar solo, or play synthesizer on some Kraftwerk, WE'RE HERE FOR IT. This won't be super structured, but knowing what songs people would like to play gives us a chance to familiarize ourselves with them first.
   * We'll have instruments on site, but we'd also welcome if people brought their own instruments as well. 
   * Everyone from the conference is welcome to check out our musical shenanigans, and there will be plenty of room for serendipity and fun.
 
I've been looking forward to this event for months, and I'm so grateful to Marc for entertaining all of my crazy shenanigans! Hope to see you in Berlin this November!
