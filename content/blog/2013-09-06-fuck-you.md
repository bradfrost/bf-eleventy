I've heard some serious shit said in meetings. 

> "We don't care about blind people." —Shithead McHorrible
 
 After I pulled my eyebrows down from the top of my head, the only words that I could muster were "Those words actually just came out of your mouth." Here's some other things we don't care about: 
 
   * BlackBerries
   * Windows Phones
   * Poor people
   * Androids
   * IE8
   * IE7
   * Definitely IE6
   * Colorblind people
   * 7" tablets
   * Firefox
   * Screen readers
   * Opera Mini
   * e-ink Kindles
   * Kindle Fires
   * Nokias
   * non-JS users
   * Sony PSPs
   * Touch users
   * Keyboard users
   * Foreign language people
 
These are all actual things I've heard expressed from either clients or colleagues. And here's why we don't care about them: 
   * Those people aren't our target demographic
   * Nobody browses the Web on those devices
   * No one would ever do this from their [outdated/clunky/quirky] device
   * It would cost too much to [support](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/) them
   * Nobody disables Javascript
   * They should just upgrade their browser
   * Nobody holds their device that way
   * They can't afford our products anyways
 
We sound like assholes. Next time you find yourself _intentionally_ depriving someone an experience—to acquire knowledge, to complete a task, to do something online that can make their life even just a little better—picture yourself standing in front of that person in real life, looking them square in the eyes, then firmly and definitively saying _"Fuck you."_
