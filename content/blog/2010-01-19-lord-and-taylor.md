Pod1 is a partner with Lord and Taylor and provide them with site creative, emails, microsites and more. Over time, I've created many microsites, easily-updatable XML Flash banners, standards-complient accessible landing pages and more

Recently I've been consulting with the ecommerce team to work around a sometimes-inflexible CMS system to make the site more accessible, faster-loading, standards-complient and SEO-friendly. I've been working to help optimize site performance, setting up testing and more to help increase site performance and reduce maintenance time.
