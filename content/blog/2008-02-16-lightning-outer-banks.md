[![Lightning Strike, OBX 2005](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2253/2267852898_d16cd6bfe1.jpg?v=0)](http://flickr.com/photos/brad_frost/2267852898/ "View this image at Brad Frost's Flickr Page") This photo was taken a few summers ago at the Outer Banks in late July. My family and I go on vacation every year there and we were given this awesome lightning storm. It was shot with my low-end Canon digital camera with a 15 second time exposure. [Here are more photos from the same storm.](http://flickr.com/photos/brad_frost/sets/72157603924799669/ "Brad Frost Flickr Photoset")
