[![book-cover](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/book-cover-700x1082.png)](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) So I am writing [a book](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/). And I am really excited about it. It's called _Atomic Design_ and it's all about creating and maintaining effective interface design systems. Here’s what I’m going to cover in the book: 
 
   * Explain why it's increasingly essential to **think of interfaces as systems rather than a collection of pages**
   * **Introduce atomic design** as a sound methodology for crafting effective interface design systems
   * **Cover tools and techniques** for creating design systems, pattern libraries, and style guides
   * Demonstrate **how to make pattern-based design and development an integral part of your process** , and detail how teams can establish and maintain their own design systems
 
How I'm Going to Do It The traditional way to write a book involves retreating to cave for months, then eventually crawling out and declaring “Behold! I've written a book for you to consume.” I’m not doing that. After spending the last year directly benefitting from [designing in the open](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/), [talking about the benefits of sharing](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/creative-exhaust/), and also working on a few closed projects that tore at my soul, I decided that I'm going to lay my book-writing process out in the open. A Living, Breathing, Incomplete Book This book is a living, breathing entity. Progress will be shared openly and the latest, greatest state will be available [online](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/). You can keep track of updates on the [Github repository](https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design/). I’ll be posting updates on my [blog](https://bradfrost.com/blog) and will be sharing my book-writing adventures and frustrations as much as time allows. When the manuscript is complete, it will become an e-book available in the most popular e-book formats. The end goal for this project is for _Atomic Design_ to exist as a physical book. While I mostly operate in the digital world, the prospect of creating a physical book is tremendously exciting. The idea is that the printing and shipping costs will be financed through preorders and eventual sales of the e-book. Who's Involved This book is written, edited, and published by me. It may stay that way. It may not. There's a chance I may bring on an editor to help bring this project to life, but that’s yet to be determined. I will most definitely bring on some people who can help review any technical aspects of the book. I currently don’t plan to go through a book publisher, but would be open to the idea if the right opportunity presented itself. Supporting the Project [**The book is available for preorder now**](http://shop.bradfrost.com/collections/frontpage/products/atomic-design-ebook). While it’s a bit unusual to sell a book that’s incomplete, the idea is to get the content out there in a timely manner and to help fund the project. By purchasing the book up front, here’s what you get: 
 
   * The **final e-book** in all available formats
   * A **heavy discount on the print edition** of the book
   * A **discount on any extras** , which may include: **videos, tutorials, sample code, and workshops**
   * **My eternal gratitude**
