I'm so incredibly excited to announce my exciting new podcast called [Wake Up Excited!](https://wakeupexcited.show/) Can you tell I'm excited? I'd absolutely love it if you [subscribe to the show](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/subscribe) and/or [watch it on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&si=a_eKXj9r95k3sk1X). A podcast about exuberance **Wake Up Excited! is a podcast about living an exuberant, creative, and fulfilling life — _despite it all_.** I explain why I feel this show is important and urgent in the [intro/trailer](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/episodes/trailer-for-wake-up-excited): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toWF2_-mqeE&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&index;=4  **I've noticed that there are people out there who move through life with intention, authenticity, creativity, kindness, and enthusiasm. And they do this despite the challenges of life and the deeply imperfect world we inhabit.** This podcast is an attempt to learn from these people in order to help us cultivate positivity and enthusiasm in our own lives. Diverse guests unified in exuberance My guests are wide-ranging and many are renowned in their respective fields, but we're not here to talk about their work. Rather, we're really here to talk about the enthusiastic mindset and philosophy of life that serves as the engine that drives their ambitious work. I launched the show with three episodes featuring friends of mine who I feel so embody the spirit of the show and mission. Denise Jacobs [Episode 1](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/1) features my friend [Denise Jacobs](https://denisejacobs.com/). Denise is a creativity evangelist, a speaker, and the author of several books, including [_Banish Your Inner Critic_](https://innercriticbook.com/). **We discuss restoring cast iron, connecting past and present passions growth through teaching, navigating this current poisonous moment in time, Denise's incredible backyard garden, and empowerment through creativity.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojg2hj3HabU&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&index;=3  Aarron Walter In [Episode 2](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/2), I talk with [Aarron Walter](https://www.aarronwalter.com/), the co-host of the [Design Better](https://designbetterpodcast.com/) and [Reconsidering](https://www.reconsidering.org/) podcasts, author of several books (including my favorite, _[Designing For Emotion](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/designing-for-emotion)_), writer, consultant, and creative leader. **We discuss the never ending process of self-improvement, the importance of curiosity, how all research is really me search, this concept of super activities,[FIRE](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/financial-independence-retire-early) and how to think about money, and lots about living an examined life and trying to be a good person.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM2clxvo6EI&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&index;=2  Jessica Hische In [Episode 3](https://podcast.wakeupexcited.show/3/transcript), I talk with my friend and creative powerhouse [Jessica Hische](https://jessicahische.is/). Jessica has created countless projects, wrote/illustrated [design and children's books](https://jessicahische.shop/collections/books), designed postage stamps, done lettering for Wes Anderson' [_Moonrise Kingdom_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonrise_Kingdom), improved countless logos, and her new venture is invoicing/payment software and community for creative professionals called [Studioworks](https://studioworks.app/team). **We discuss using positivity and enthusiasm to fight all the negativity engulfing our world,[ADHD](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/adhd/) and mental health, balancing our personal responsibilities with our responsibilities to the world at large, engaging with local community, creativity breadth & depth, creativity over time, and a whole lot more.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBaU_FQm_w&list;=PLRVyFmnlMfe0lMYaPF6zcT2JVUdpAjg9-&index;=1&t;=1s  More guests on the way! Of course, these episodes are just the beginning; I've already recorded so many amazing conversations and am so excited to have even more. I'm drawing on my amazing friends to help get the show off the ground, and have really big ambitions beyond people I know personally (you should see my guest wish list!). Lots of amazing stuff on the horizon! The definition of a passion project It feels so good to finally have these important conversations I've been desperate to have for so long. This show truly is a labor of love, which also means **the show is entirely self-funded**. There's a lot of hard work and moving parts in order to create a high-quality show. That of course costs money. You can support this project, my work, and my family by checking out [our online courses](https://bradfrost.com/courses/):
