At [Clarity Conference](http://clarityconf.com/) in San Francisco, [Anna Pickard](http://annapickard.com/) discussed everything that goes into creating a cohesive voice and tone at [Slack](https://slack.com/). Here are my notes: 
 
   * Anna works at Slack, and is tasked with making a style guide to deal with the company's fast growth. The goal is to maintain a consistent tone of voice, as they want Slack to feel like another member of your team. How do you scale that?
   * Rules: glossary and grammar, oxford comma, emdash, etc.
   * They created a [Gloss Bot](https://github.com/codeforamerica/glossary-bot), which is a Slack bot that pulls up definitions and rules around grammar
   * **Voice and tone** : Asking people to be like you ends up with them doing a bad impression of you. How do you sound human and strike the write tone?
   * Slack looks for opportunities to communicate in a human way with their users. Loading messages contain human language, and their release notes are famously long. They get people excited about using the application and serve as a learning opportunity. Tweets are general and positive. Error messages contain empathy for the user.
   * Style rules: **important to define what you _don't_ sound like and what you _don't_ do.**
   * Looked at MailChimp's [Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/) as a starting point.  _This but not that_ is a good place to start.
   * Break down the voice into shared characteristics of the brand.
   * **Empathy:** Who am I talking to? What emotional state are they in? What is the context? What do I want them to take away from this?
   * **Courtesy:** getting out of people's way and letting them get out of the way. Am I providing the information people need? What can I do to simplify this message? How does this help the user? Is this actually intuitive? Do I need speak at all? Take the time to write concise stuff.
   * **Craftsmanship:** let people know how and why you're making the decisions you're making. Work as transparently as possible. Is this as good as I can make it? Could someone else make it better? What are the options?
   * **Playfulness:** have an open mind. What do error messages (amongst other things) usually sound like? How can I do this differently? Put a different spin on it.
   * **Honesty:** be open and honest and fair to your users. Is this really what I want to say? Is this really the way I would say it? How human does it sound if I read it out load?
   * **Creating a style guide is about finding a "unity of intention."**
