[![Shop Talk Show Podcast](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-21-at-3.17.15-PM.png)](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/035-with-brad-frost/) I had a great time talking with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert on their web design podcast [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/035-with-brad-frost/). There was some great discussion about responsive design, including: 

  * **[This Is Responsive](http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/index.html)** \- what this project is attempting to do
  * **Large screen responsive design** \- how to handle larger screens like cinema displays, TVs and more.
  * **Responsive layouts vs adaptive layouts** \- we talk about the pros and cons of serving several fixed widths layouts across screens
  * **Dealing with grids for mobile-first design** \- we talk about the challenges of incorporating grids and layout when starting with far more linear mobile layouts
  * **Which units to use for breakpoints and type** \- I talk about the importance of using relative units for media queries and we talk about the pros and cons of using ems and rems
  * **What are some great web/mobile conferences to attend?** \- We talk about the upcoming [In Control Conference](http://incontrolconference.com/) and [Breaking Development Conference](http://bdconf.com/) and how awesome they are/are going to be.
  * **How to deliver '[Opt Out Responsive Design?](http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/)' experiences** \- we talk about why the use case is legit and some of the considerations for including a "view full site" link for responsive designs
  * **Conditional Loading** \- I got to talk about one of what I feel is one of the most important aspects of responsive design.
