BIG NEWS! We're hard at work making an online course called [Subatomic: The Complete Guide To Design Tokens](https://designtokenscourse.com/). Over the past decade, [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA1fPEQBXLNZt3W9ibBEHUUrIBCq7zcVmV0)[Ian Frost](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-frost-45817163/) and I have created design token systems for dozens of organizations — including some of the largest organizations in the world — to help them power their multi-product, multi-brand, multi-platform, multi-generation, Multi-All-The-Things product landscapes. ![Animated GIF showing a button component switching between 5 different aesthetic themes](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/theme-button-1.gif) **We've have seen so many design system teams struggle to establish/evolve a solid design token architecture** , which is why we're so excited to create this comprehensive course. We want to save teams time, money, and agony by sharing all of our hard-earned lessons, core concepts, Figma and code architecture, naming conventions, and processes to help teams successfully create and maintain robust design token systems. What's in the course We're going deep and providing everything we possibly can to set teams up for design tokens success. The course includes:
 
   * Over 10 hours of in-depth videos
   * Figma & code sample architecture
   * Naming & governance workflows
   * PDF with examples and resources
   * Certificate of completion
   * [Live team training option](https://courses.bradfrost.com/order?ct=a8152d3e-7e19-4792-8a64-9cd71a531fc0)
 
In my opinion, the sample Figma and code architecture alone is worth the price of admission. This architecture has been vetted and iterated over with dozens of teams, and our consulting clients leap for joy whenever we bust these assets out. In our experience, having a jumping off point that isn't overly-prescriptive is the sweet spot, and that's what we're aiming for with this entire course. Solid foundational knowledge backed up by working architecture that teams can take forward and customize to their organization's specific needs.  Taking Preorders Now Ian and I are hard at work putting the course together and are aiming to have the first chapters out in January. While we produce the course, we're offering limited preorders to passionate design system practitioners that are eager to elevate their game and want to come along this journey with us. Preordering the course gets you:
 
   * Over 25% off the full price
   * Exclusive videos with tips, mistakes to avoid, resources, and homework while we put the full course together 
   * First access to course content as it becomes available
   * Help shape the course as its made by giving us feedback
   * Access to a private Slack channel
   * Our eternal gratitude for supporting us
 
**[Sign up for the email list](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order) to preorder the course** and/or to stay in the loop. We're going to be sharing plenty of design tokens tips and resources along with course updates along the way. An exciting format **This is a new adventure!** I'm incredibly excited for so many reasons, including diving into this new format.  We've done so much work co-creating and consulting with SO MANY TEAMS through so many client engagements. On top of that, I've run countless workshops at conferences, companies, and online events. I've even made a [Skillshare class](https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/digital-product-design-build-a-flexible-design-system-that-lasts/1170825650?srsltid=AfmBOop6DfTytBsrGRcA7JS1JNidFxayajT4rJwl4rz2kKuub5dq4SB8), a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCcfWigKv_s), and many other projects. **But here's the thing: there's never been enough time**. Due to the pesky laws of physics, time, and space, we always run out of runway. I've long wanted to go deep and comprehensive with a number of topics, and the online course format finally gives us a chance to do just that. WE ARE SO FREAKING PUMPED. [The course website](https://designtokenscourse.com/) was a hell of a lot of fun to make and shows off what design tokens can unlock for you: [![The Subatomic online course website switching themes between the regular design, dark mode, and a funny obnoxious theme](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/website-theme-switch-1.gif)](https://designtokenscourse.com/) So head over there and [sign up to the newsletter](https://designtokenscourse.com/#order) to get preorder info and hop on the tokens train with us.
