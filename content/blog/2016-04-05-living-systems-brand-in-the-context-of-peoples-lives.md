At [Clarity Conference](http://clarityconf.com/) in San Francisco, [Jeremy Perez-Cruz](http://www.jeremyperezcruz.com/) talked about the human elements that go into great brand systems. Here are my notes: 
 
   * Jeremy founded Etsy's global brand design studio, and he believes the future of branding is in-house. After that, he went to PepsiCo and ultimately to Uber.
   * What is Brand? There are two definitions. Ogilvy's, which is **"a product and it's attributes."** The other definition is more intangible: **"A person's gut feeling about a product or company."** Brand is an invisible art that's instinctively felt.
   * As a brand systems creator, you should be a psychologist, a designer, and a magician. There's a slight of hand involved as **you're trying to get people to feel the way we want them to feel.** All three of those things involve human perception.
   * Types of branding work: Studio work (doing work for clients), corporate (bureaucracy, global in scale), startups (many startups don't establish an actual brand until they reach a certain point)
   * Iteration is crucial. A great brand should be seen as a living, breathing investment. There shouldn't be a black box around the brand system and it should be tested in the real world. Brand and product designers should work closely together.
   * Brand in the context of human lives means exhibiting sympathy. How do we design for human lives?
   * **Breathe** -Brand guidelines should move and flex. Sometimes you have to break the guidelines in order to make something look good. Feedback is one of the most important aspects of a successful design system.
   * **Grow** \- Define the guidelines and grow and make more comprehensive over time.
   * **Learn** \- We all start with the basics. Test things out. You won't know what works and what doesn't until you actually try it out.
   * **Feel** \- Emotional aspect of the brand. Laugh, cry, etc
   * **Fear** \- A great idea scares the crap out of everyone. At Etsy, anyone can push production code to the live site, which is a scary concept.
   * **Age** \- It's ok to have a patina on your system as it leads to authenticity over time.
