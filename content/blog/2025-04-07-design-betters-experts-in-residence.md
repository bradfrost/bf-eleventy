I'm thrilled to announce that I'm part of [Design Better's new Experts in Residence program](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/introducing-design-betters-experts)! [![](https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1024x1024.png)](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/introducing-design-betters-experts) Thank you so much for including, [Aarron and Eli!](https://designbetterpodcast.com/about) It's truly an honor to appear alongside Very Smart People [Kristen Berman](https://kristenberman.substack.com/) and [Ryan Rumsey](https://www.ryanrumsey.com/). We had a great kickoff call together, and honestly we could have just hit the record button and it would have been great. So I'm super excited about what lies ahead! Here's how they're describing it:

> Much like how venture firms bring in seasoned pros to guide entrepreneurs, we’re teaming up with some of the most talented people in design and tech to share their expertise with you. What to expect Each month, our Experts in Residence will share exclusive content through:

  * In-depth articles in _[The Brief](https://designbetterpodcast.com/t/the-brief) _newsletter
  * Short-form interviews exploring their specialized expertise
  * AMAs where you can ask our experts questions directly
  * Workshops and learning opportunities for individuals and organizations
  * 

 
 I'm so incredibly impressed by the quality and output of the Design Better community; it's been a real treat and honor to be able to participate in it in a few different ways. In fact, I was [just on the Design Better Podcast](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/brad-frost), where we talked about why we're still passionate about design systems after 12 years, the human side of design systems, the power of design tokens, our design tokens course, the importance of relationships, ADHD, and a whole lot more.
